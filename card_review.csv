Your articles are quite impressive and you right that non of the indian website gives enough information to chose a right card.
I hold a diners rewards with a limit of 1 lac but i spend more than 5 lacs a month on that card due to points and i use if for my travel purpose.
I called up hdfc to know about the points break up but they were clueless about it.
I need to ask you 2 questions: firstly can i get the break up of the points , say for example i spend 1 lac in a travel website and say another 50k in shopping so can i know how much points i got for each transaction as that would make the points calculation easy. Though i know its gives 3points on every 150 spent double the point if i exceed above 10k and 10x on few websites but it becomes very difficult to undersand when i get the total points in the end AND secondly
Since this is the first time i m using a credit card so can i put in excess money in my account and use it since a lot of times my single purchase is over a lac and due to lack of limit im not being able to use it.
Looking forward for your reply.

I am currently holding HDFC regalia (master card). In an upgrade requested, they are offering me Diners black card. But the reviews of this card are not very good elsewhere online. In contrast, you have given a positive review about this card. The catch is that I have to surrender Regalia to grab Diners black as they arenâ€™t allowing to have both the cards at the same time. However I have SBI signature as a backup card if Diners card is not accepted, but I am little confused as is it worth surrendering Regalia to have Diners black? People have raised concerns over itâ€™s poor acceptability.

I've rarely used the card and when I used it for the first time, it was for a small amount. The next month, I made purchases worth Rs.1430 and verified the same via their Netbanking. My Bill's due date was 4th of April 2005 and I dropped a cheque (issued by HDFC bank, where my salary goes) on 24th March 2005. I was busy with other things and suddenly on 28th when I was casually checking my HDFC bank account I found two entries (one debit and one credit) for the amount. It read: (the first one is the re-credit and the second one is the debit). 26 Mar 2005 I/W Chq Ret-ALTERATION REQUIRE DRAWER AU 000000523692 26 Mar 2005 1430.00 ... 26 Mar 2005 Chq Paid-MICR CLG-HYDERABAD 000000523692 26 Mar 2005 1430.00 ... So, clearly, there is some confusion with regard to an alteration made by me. But I remember writing the number wrongly and correcting it and signing at the correction. I waited for a few days to get an official correspondence from HSBC about bouncing of the cheque but got none ( I got only two calls: one from their Car Loans section and one from their Personal loans section asking me if I am interested to avail the loans). In desperation that my due date might approach, I wrote to their netbanking officer and received a reply that my cheque has bounced due to ''ALTERATION REQ SIG OF DRW''. (I am forbidden even to copy their mail and paste it here). I immediately dropped another cheque for the fear of being levied the Over-Due fine. After all these days (when I toured etc) I finally could make it to their bank today. One person asked me to go to the first floor and when I reached there, the security after calling the in-mates, led me into another chamber where a handful of people were busy with earphone/mic sets (obviously looking like call-centre executives). One man (whome Im supposed to meet, Mr. Ashok) was busy over a phone and when his conversation ended, he asked me what I wanted. I explained the situation to him. Firstly, he did not bother to answer my question, Why no one from the office called me up to inform that my cheque bounced. Then, he was trying to explain to me the fact that any alteration on a cheque requires a signature (even though I told him that I knew it). Then, visibly angry, I told him that I wanted to see the instrument (cheque) and he verified its date and told me that since it was issued last month, I have to wait for a minimum of 2 working days to see it. Then, another of his collegue, in the most disgusting tone told me that I could go to HDFC bank and check the same as they are legally supposed to make a copy of the same before returning back. This advice was to avoid any probability that I be promised to get the same in 2 days and if it doesnt happen, it is an awkward situation for HSBC...... Now, I dont understand, why are they boasting of customer service? Is this what HSBC means by customer service, that they dont even show the instruments issued by the customers when they bounce and talk in the most stupid manner (without even offering a seat to the customer all the while), dont inform the customers when something unforseen happens, because they can levy extra bucks owing to late payment????

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,4/22/05,User,5,"HSBC Credit Card was the first ever card that I began to use and maybe it holds a sentimental value to me. I was in Bangalore in 2001 when the HSBC agent approached me and said that they were issuing HSBC cards to doctors for a joining fee of 360 only. I was not sure about using credit cards and was hesitant when I furnished my details. In a week the verification process were done and they also asked me to write a slogan for them. I did it in a hurry but I managed to impress them. I got the card which was a ''MasterCard'' in few days and with it came a letter that I had won ''10gm'' of gold from Tanishq. That was a great start with the Card. (I'll never forget it as I used this gold coin to make my earrings for my wedding). Initially the limit given to me was only 15000., but I never bothered as I didn't use it much. Gradually with my regular payments (full payments), they rewarded me by increasing my limits as well as gifting me with their Visa Card. When I shifted to another State, I called them up and asked them to change the billing/mailing address, which they did so promptly within a week, whereas, the other cards that I had, took me ten phone calls and disappointment for the change of address and ultimately landed up cancelling them. Today I have other cards which have been given on some scheme and at times they have better service but ''I still manage to swipe only my HSBC card'' especially because of my petrol usage as they waive off the surcharge (500- 3000). In between, thay did have a lot of complains as they stopped sending my statements and the phone banking no. too had to be held for half an hour to get to speak to the phone banking officer, but my written complaints to the head office were definitely taken note off, and it's back to happy days with my HSBC card. I can bet that their Phone Banking officials are the best in the market in terms of etiquette, patience and mannerisms as well as a good command in English.

Issue: Salesman comes to my hostel(m an undergrad student), offers service free for the first year.. takes my licence and i-card, fills the form for me. answers most of my queries, says i'll get a verficiation call in a few days. I get the verification call.. happily verify. two weeks from filling the form, I have my credit card in my hand. credit limit 10k, good enough for the docs i'd given. I've been using it happily ever after.. at restaurants and online.. and hsbc online gives rather good account statements which makes it rather convenient. Guess.. after having heard a friend's experience with ICICI.. I am completely happy and no cribs about the HSBC credit card. My first account statement included an Annual fee of 350 rupees plus service tax.. but I called the customer service and they happily said that if I was promised free for the first year.. they'd make sure its reversed. and yes THE FEE WAS REVERSED. Yeah, they do charge a transaction fee of 150 bucks when used at ATMs to draw cash... but I guess most banks do that anyway.

Statement recevied within one day of generation (ABN takes 5 days), and gave me ample time to plan repayment. I would definitely advice someone going for a Gold or better card.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,5/19/05,User,3,"Do you have a credit card? Do they charge you annual fees? Well now-a-days all banks are offering free credit cards, meaning no annual fees.

Tell them point blank that you want this amount rolled back. Otherwise you want the card cancelled. Don't take any answer but yes for the rollback. 100% sure they will rollback the amount. I have tried it, and so have many of my friends. So good luck and happy free credit card! Web site : HSBC has a good web site easily navigable and secure. But expect some slowness at times as the server may be experiencing too much traffic. Hint - login  during off-peak times.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/5/05,User,3," [The Deal ] One of the HSBC card agents called me an offered me their gold card for free (for life!!).. I tried it.. I called the card company on receipt of the card to make sure it was free for life as nothing of that soft was written on the brochures that they sent along with the cardâ€¦  [The Catch ]I was told that the card is free  only for first yearâ€¦ This was a huge set backâ€¦. And I immediately wanted the card cancelledâ€¦ Their customer care guys called me from Mumbai..  [The Deal ] and have promised me that they would waive off the annual charges every yearâ€¦  [The Catch ] â€¦but I would need to call them every time during renewal, to get the annual waived..  [The Deal ] Good Card.. good credit limits..  [The Catch ]  They have silly conditions likeâ€¦ I have to be a member of Delhi golf club, if I need a photo card!!!! (isnâ€™t that weird??) They donâ€™t provide updates on sms.. a service which is provided by Citibank.  [The Deal ]  0% balance transfer for 3 monthsâ€¦ Credit card holder gets 80% of his credit limit as the limit to which he can transfer the balance from other credit cards. it was extremely useful to me as I spend around 30K on my other credit card during vacation traveling. I could easily break down the amount to 10K per month for 3 months without any interest!!!!  [The Catch ]  Although this was free at first...These days.. they charge a proceesing fee of 2% on the amount taken....Also remember to pay up in 3 months if you have availed this facility.. or else they charge interest..  [The Deal ]  0% fuel surchargeâ€¦.. They are aiming only at four wheel owners.  [The Catch ]   To avail this facility you need to buy fuel at least for Rs. 400/-  I have come to know that Abn Amro credit card also offers the same facility without any minimum amount limitations!!!  [The Deal ]  If you are frequent traveler on flights.. this card could bring some  Travel benefits to you as you get 3% off on domestic tickets.. and 2.5% on international sector tickets.. also the tickets are home delivered to you..  [The Catch ]  They have tie up with ITH â€“ India Travel Houseâ€¦ you HAVE to book through them.. nobody else would doâ€¦  [The Deal ]  If you are a good card user.. u get good  Insurance Benefits also.. especially airline travel insurance..  [The Catch ] Dude.. just holding the card wont do.. you have to USE it.. no money if you die without spending!!!  [The Deal ]  Loan on phone facility enables you to convert any of your purchases (above Rs. 5000/-) to a loan.. meaning you could pay back in EMIâ€™sâ€¦.  [The Catch ]  but I would not recommend this facility to anyone.. as there are many hidden charges.. such as processing charges. Prepayment charges etc.. instead you should opt for a personal loan from a nationalized bankâ€¦  [The Deal ]  Customer Care.. my experience with their customer care has been goodâ€¦ Although they have an extremely unfriendly â€œtelephonicâ€ menu while you call them.. once you are used to it.. the navigation gets easyâ€¦ also the executives come on line pretty fast and solve most of your queriesâ€¦  [The Catch ]  Their call centre is based in Mumbai.. be prepared to send STD faxes.. in case you want to send any written communication to themâ€¦for eg.. I wanted to send my outstanding transfer form to them fasterâ€¦ hence I wanted to fax it.. so had to use STD!!!!  [The Deal ]  Global Access to your HSBC India account a good option if you have any type of savings / deposit account with themâ€¦ you could use your credit card itself to withdraw money or transfer funds (no need for a separate ATM / Debit card)â€¦ from all over the world!!!!!  [The Catch ] You NEED to have an HSBC account.. no other bank account would do.. and for their account you need to maintain a balance of Rs. 10k..(in case of a simple savings account)  [The Deal ]  You get one  Reward point for every one hundred rupees spent on the card.  [The Catch ] This is not a big dealâ€¦. you get 1 point for every Forty Rupees spend on an AMEX card!! So I could observe that with every deal that they put forwardâ€¦ they also threw in a catch!! Hence.. a decent card if you are really careful about your spending.. and take care about all  [The Catches ].. Also I would definitely not recommend this card if they donâ€™t give it to you free for lifeâ€¦ Nor worth spending 2000 bucks every year!! â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..

I received hundreds of calls from HSBC to apply for this card and it was only 1.5 months of mine joining the company.Ultimately to get rid of all these calls I applied for this card.They stated that the card is lifetime free for all the employees of my company and that was the primary reason of applying. After some 3 months I received a letter from HSBC saying that they cannot proceed with it right now as my eligibility does not meet. I was very relaxed as now I can get rid of all the calls and the card too but to my discomfort I received the card just 2 days back and since it is a lifetime free card I thought of keeping it.But when I called the customer care today to apply for the Netbanking password I asked the executive and she said that HSBC never issues any lifetime free card to anybody.

I got this offer from HSBC some two years back and grabbed it as nobody was offering the same at that time. I must say that I am very happy with the services of HSBC. By enrolling for online billing, they gifted a CD (songs). Their online service is very good. One can view the transactions almost immediately on thier web-site. The web site is not heavy and opens quickly. They give 10% cash back offer from time to time. One has to enroll for it by calling customer care number or filling a form online. The offer is on certain categories like apparells, furniture etc.. One must enroll to avail the offer!! The cash is credited in the account after the scheme is over. Its not that I have not encountered any problem but I always write back and HSBC Customer Care is too good. They always revert promptly and till date all of my problems/queries have been replied upto my satisfaction (mind it, I don't get satisfied easily ).

Regarding the Annual fee, I got the charges included in my monthly statement. I wrote back explaining that I have been told by their executive that its a free for life card. Next day I got a mail stating that the charges are reversed. So I can't say anything negative regarding their service. I also tried their Telebanking service and found that it is also cool.

They have flexible policies and do not stress out customers. Phone Banking: Operations like address change etc can be done on phone after the verification process is done. Unlike other banks, you don't have to go to a branch and fill out a form. Proves customer friendliness. Internet Banking: The best internet banking site I have seen so far. (ICICI is good too, but HSBC is the easiest to use). The interface is simple and straightforward. Reward Points: With their Rewards Programme, they really show customers how much they care. If you use a Gold Card, you get a point for every 100 Rupees to spend. And you can exchange your points for really good gifts. I exchanged my points for a Philips Iron, a very useful product. They give several other gifts. For example those customers who opted for E-Statements instead of paper statements got a pocket FM Radio. They don't call unnecessarily with offers. In my one year of using HSBC Card, I hardly received 2 calls from HSBC. The recent fraud commited by a HSBC employee has definitely affected the bank's reputation, but I still treat it as a stray case and continue to trust the bank. I hope they maintain the same efficiency in the times to come.",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New
HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,8/1/06,User,1,"This is my second review and incidentally both reviews are on Banks (last time HDFC) .  Now HSBC has replaced HDFC as worst banking experience. It makes me wonder if all those people singing praises of HSBC are either paid by bank to canvas for them or employees of this bank. It all started two weeks back.  I received a packet from HSBC with security device( Logging on to online@hsbc need you to authenticate by this device) and felt happy that bank is improving security of its customers and little did I knew that it is start of my trouble. I registered my security device and used it couple of times and could easily log on to online site. I have gold card which is life time free card. One day I saw my account being charged with Rs2000+tax as annual fee.I now hold this card for 3 years and every year it is custom for HSBC to charge me annual fee and reverse it back after I remind them that card is supposed to be life time free card. I did same thing this time and called the bank they acknowledge that it is their mistake and they will reverse it. Next day I try to login to online site, I get error Incorrect login credentials (Error D008). I try to get to customer support (25589696 ) and after trying for more then 10 minutes I could hear to a HUMAN voice. I explain that HUMAN about my problems after going through all the usual security checks and couple of holds. they note the problem and say that it is problem with my security device and I have to call a TOLL FREE number. (In india toll free numbers ar a joke. you won't be able to figure out which service provider can get you to it as BSNL toll free numbers cant be reached from TOUCHTEL and vice versa) . Then I find a phone from where I can call the toll free number ( remember it will not work from coin booths or public PCO's or even your cell )  and tell this agent my problem after again repeating steps ( Security questions + couple of holds ) the agent tells me I have call bank number 25589696 and only they can help me. Ok. I again call bank, retry for more then 10 times, wait for more the 5 minutes hearing bank advertisements and then human agent speaks to me. I explain my problem and after ( Security questions + couple of holds ) agent tells me to try after a day and problem will go away. I try next day and still cant log on to online@hsbc. I call customer support and one more agent greets me. I ask for escalating my call to senior and person insists that only he can help me and I have to explain him problem. I comply then I am put on hold (more then 14 minutes) and suddenly I hear disconnected tone in phone. Either phone timed out or agent disconnected me purposely donâ€™t know what happened. I retry repeat same steps with one more agent who convinces me that he will fix my problem. He also agrees to call me back with status. I agree (what else can I do?)  I receive a call after  a day from this agent that technical team is working on my problem and they will call me. I donâ€™t hear back anything for next two days and try customer support again. This time I insisted the agent to escalate the call to next level. Which she dint agree to and tells me that previous agent has updated the Call Log with status as ""Resolved""? . How can they close the call with out fixing my problem I ask and this agent tells me that my system has been reset and I should try again. I try again and wonâ€™t help. Again call customer service and this agent finally agrees to escalate my call (I was kept on hold for 8 minutes) . I speak with this senior customer support person and she says my problem has been solved(they have reset security device) and I should retry after 2 hours. I try and still same error , cant access my account. Before I disconnected from last call I have also taken the Fax number of bank 022 24981135 as I no longer want to call the customer support. Some statistics of the whole episode: Number of calls made >80 Number of times got connected to phone bank ~8 times. Number of agents spoken with 6. Number of  disconnections 2 Approximate Call time+Menu Time + wait time(hearing ads) + hold time(when agent puts you on hold)  + explaining time = > 90 Minutes. When each minute is money I have lost 3 precious hours (including time taken to write this review) because of incompetent agents working at HSBC. Final out come :  A  frustrated customer whose problem has not yet been fixed by the bank. I am now going to send fax to bank with print out of this review and see if that fixes my problem. Any case I am going to throw this card away for Good once my account is settled with bank. Good by HSBC.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/13/06,User,1,"I have been a customer of HSBC for the past 6 years and, believe me, I have failed till date to get a debit card or credit card from the bank in spite of numerous applications in their application forms. I had, in August, 2005 applied to a Debit Card and got instead an unactivated credit card. They asked me to send a PAN Card copy along with an activation request form for activation. I promptly sent it  in the designated envelope. I waited for a month and visited the HSBC bank personally to enquire. I was told that card related queries can only be entertained over phonebanking. Earth shattering security system really ! When I managed to get through, I was told that no such document reached them. They promised to send me a fresh form at my residence, which they did after about a month and I gave the boy a fresh PAN card copy and filled up the form again. I was told that my card would be activated in a week. That week stretched for a month and I finally decided to write personally to one Mr. Bholla, supposedly a senior finctionary of the Bank in Mumbai,  describing my condition. I got a letter within 15 days. Needless to say the letter contained 'sweet nothings' . Accompanied with the letter was a photocopy of a fresh activation request form which I duly filled and enclosing another PAN card copy sent to them. This was early this year. As of today I have failed to get the card activated. In the meantime I made a fresh application for a Debit card five weeks ago. I am yet to get it. There is no doubt that there is something wrong with the HSBC Card division. Worst, you cannot even write to the senior functionaries over E-mail, and over phone, no person at the other end would ever give the line to somebody senior. This is in contrast to the treatment, again sweet nothings, you get when you personally visit a  HSBC Branch. Only a couple of weeks ago, I was asked by the receptionist of a branch whether I was satisfied with the services. Knowing that it would be fruitless to complain to them, I said 'yes', upon which  I was asked to sign on a red coloured card with a smile symbol on it giving my account number. Indeed another sweet nothing !   I am seriously thinking of switching to another Bank with meaningfully efficient services without meaningless external gloss and hullaballoo. It seems that HSBC's Cards division has become another 'sarkari' department where you get a lot of sweeties said to you, but where you hardly get the service you need.",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New
HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/20/06,User,1,"Hi, I am having the same experience with HSBC Gold Corporate Card. An agent from HSBC Bund Garden branch : Kishan Rajoria approached me with this offer of LIFETIME FREE CREDIT CARD. Before applying, I confirmed multiple times whether this is really a lifetime free card, and was told that there were NO ANNUAL FEES and NO JOINING FEES.    Besides that I asked extensive questions regarding interest rates, credit limit, etc. and noted down information in detail. The card application took exceptionally long to get processed, and when, a month and half later,  the card arrived, it had a Tariff Sheet  stating  ANNUAL FEE RS. 2000. I called up their Customer Care number 020 66028585/ 28686, and was told that my application itself that was forwarded to them, was NOT for the lifetime free at all!! They said that since wrong info was given to me, they are ready to waiver the annual fees whenever they are charged to me. When I asked them a written confirmation of this, they said no sorry we cant give you anything in writing!! Would you take their word for it?? Now top this: I could not contact the agent Kishan for almost a week after that. When I finally got in touch with him, he says, oh yesss for your job profile you will not be charged  any annual fees for ONE YEAR!! Isnt that great?? When I mentioned to him about his initial ""lifetime offer"" he says, no sorry HSBC does not have any lifetime free offer at all. So I said, ok then I want to cancel the card, he says..suuuuuuuuure cancel it and then you can apply again later and see if they will give you a lifetime free card!! Needless to say I was thoroughly disgusted and hung up... Are these the kind of unethical agents a reputed bank such as HSBC is hiring, who falsify information just to get their commisions?????

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/21/06,User,1,"Yes I fully agree with this review. I had very similar experience some 3 months back, their agent came to my office, tried to convince me for taking the card, when I told him that I was not interested he even went to the level of emotional blackmail saying I should show some pity as he has to complete the target given to him. Other conditions were same i.e. Gold card, life time free etc. etc. Lastly just to get rid of the headache I asked him to fill the form.  After 1 and half moth I received a printed letter from HSBC saying that they were not in position to issue a card to me and my application was rejected. I felt so embarassed as if I was begger and asking for some alms to HSBC. Most of the MNC banks are treating Indians in the similar manners. We are the fools to allow them to make money here.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/22/06,User,4,"A Credit Card is a plastic card. It is not money like many think and spend, but it is a transacting key for a safe which is your account. The more you transact and the less you pay in time, your safe gets emptier faster. A Credit Card is safe as long as you do not loose that in the net or in the street and as long as it is used with care and Judgment.  HSBC Gold Card-Shear Gold from your local Bank HSBC Bank (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, which was established in 1865 to finance in Europe and mainland China ) became one of the leading multi national banks in the world headquartered in London. Its principles and practice had led it to emerge as one of the leading players in Personal & Corporate Banking including Credit Cards around the world. Though it does not have so many branches or ATM in India unlike ICICI Bank or others, it has really lived upto its statement â€œWorldâ€™s local Bankâ€. I applied for HSBC Card some ten years back which turned out to be my first Credit Card with a humble beginning with a credit limit of Rs 15000/-.It has lived the test of time and become two Gold Cards, Master and Visa with Credit limits above Rs 3,00,000/- each and have really become a useful tool for my Personal as well as Business purposes since then while other cards like American express, Citibank and ICICI Bankâ€™s have got either faded or erased into darkness. What makes HSBC Gold Card shine above the rest for me?  It is truly a local Banking Card for me. Perfect service every month by the HSBC Personnel who calls up and takes appointment and picks up the cheque payment. I donâ€™t even have to go searching for drop box. Even if I am traveling and the payment gets delayed for couple of days, the Chennai office calls up to find out when they can pickup the payment. Telephone banking has been highly responsible and efficient. A Monthly statement that reflects clarity and perfection in billing. For someone who has been using their card for Ten years, not a single false transaction, clear interest charges and Bonus point details makes it very transparent. For the last two years I have been using Internet Banking which has been very user friendly and detailed including present Transactions, net worth and Bonus Point rewards. You can also correspond to them by M2M kind of messages which is fast unlike MS and receives prompt attention without getting deleted. The site ( hsbc.co.in ) is comprehensive and complete in all respects for any information that you may want. I pay my annual subscription through bonus points and they have been kind enough to waive the fee on three occasions. They have allowed payments in excess of credit limit on numerous occasions and I have never been declined till date which is the best part of HSBC. The ICICI and Amex have been very stingy in this regard and I have discarded both of them.  The Bonus rewards program has been truly a golden bonus for me. I almost get my clothing needs done by that every year which is quite good. They send the gift vouchers within 3 days of reclaiming the Bonus on the net. The amex took more than 20 days once. Everyone thinks that AMEX Cards are the best for balance transfers. What use having a global card like Amex which you cannot use in many Counters in India. HSBC offers the same privilege with a perpetual balance transfer of 0.99% from other cards, which does not put a dig on  your safe. HSBC is sending free issue of Auto Magazine every month as well as subsidized subscription rates on Business India. The key to using a right card in present scenario is to pick a card which gives multiple benefits in a mixed bag. Look out for the following one or many benefits from a card if you want to get the best out of any card. Free Card for life- They are normally combined with other agencies like Petrol companies and airline companies. The Credit limit will be low and interest charges high. Partnership cards between airline companies, petrol companies which are chargeable and avail free petrol surcharge and EMI on air tickets. Balance transfer options to pay lesser interest. International card & 5. Online usage facility.  HSBC Gold cards being premium cards offer all the facilities except that they are not free for life. You can always pay from Bonus points if planned judiciously. When you offer gold, it always gets hunted. That is what I found one fine day couple of months back. I found a pouch from this Bank on my table and when I opened it, was pleasantly surprised to see a Digital key. I thought for a moment whether it was some kind of a gift from HSBC but realized that it was a security key for Internet Transactions. What was a pleasant surprise to me was a rude shock to HSBC. One of the HSBC workers hacked them to the tune of 2,33,000 Â£ from the 20 UK Customers whose money was transacted by Nadeem Kashmiri. HSBC being one of the leading card companies with over 100 million cards was as prone to hacking as any other Bank and whooping 2 Billion $ are lost in Card Fraud every year. Harshâ€™s rev keeps reminding everyone as to the safety of transacting on the net and having transacted 100s of times with my HSBC Card, I feel I am lucky and the security key will go in a big way in protecting Internet Banking because every time, you log on, you are asked the key number which is different every time you press the key. What I would like to see HSBC doing better More drop centres, ATMs, AUTO DEBIT facility other than metros (not available in Hyderabad), lesser annual fees, Air ticket EMI facility. Caution : HSBC Gold Cards are issued with lot of prudence and never opt for it unless you can afford premium Cards.You can opt for Classic Cards.  For people who think card is the smartest thing, one can possess, here is the story of Madhavan and Kamal in lessons of life Movie Anbe Sivam. Madhavan opens his wallet in a Hotel in Orrisa and tells the waiter,â€ Diners,Amex,Visa,Master which one you want."" The waiter replies back,â€ Here Card ward kuch nahin chalta, paisa do nahin tho roti pisso."" If People who want to carry more number of cards than 100 rupee notes in their purse, they have to head straight to Kitchen because there are still many places in the world which do not accept cards. For People who think Credit cards are most valuable thing in life, there are definitely more valuable cards like Report Cards from School, Wedding Card, Greeting Cards from dear ones, visiting card and your photo id card which get you addressed and memory card in your Brain, but when you need to pay a Hospital bill in emergency situation, your credit card becomes most valuable. I find many MSians blaming card companies left and right but fail to understand the need to repay in time and it just helps if the minimum amount balance is paid off. Following golden rules is the key to successful card maintenance. So think before you swipe a card because it will also wipe your bank account. And go for a Card which is Honest like HSBC.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,2/7/07,User,1,"If someone even whispers HSBC in the middle of the night, I will jump out of my bed screaming. This is the level of anxiety and panic I have gone through since the first ever (and only) transaction I made using my HSBC Credit Card. It was the transaction I made on that fateful day due to which I lost faith in the convenience of using plastic money. It wasnâ€™t the first time I have used a credit card to pay my bills so itâ€™s not like I was trudging this dreary lane. Lemme begin on how it all started. I got a call from a HSBC agent one day that they are offering a â€œLifetime Free Credit Cardâ€. Although I already had SBI and ICICI Credit Cards I thought one more card would do me no harm (aah!! the lack of prudence). So, I went ahead and asked her how I should go about it. On hearing this, the tone of her voice changed from that of the hopeful to that of the ecstatic. She rapidly told me the about the papers I needed to submit to an agent who would collect them from my office. Saying this she ended the conversation on a happy note by saying. Have a Pleasant Day Sir. Before I could have a chance to contemplate, I received a phone call from one Mr.HSBC that he has come to collect my documents and that he was already at my office gate!!!! (I thought, what FASHT SIR-vice!!!). I told the guy I still needed around 5 minutes to get the print-outs and he said he would wait. I took all the documents needed and went towards the main gate (pretty loooong walk) to meet Mr.HSBC. I went there and gave him a call and suddenly I noticed an anxious face looking around for the caller. Finally, our eyes met (Iâ€™m straight, he he) and I confirmed his identity. He readily took my documents and made me sign in more than a few places (this is the most painful part of applying for a credit card, the agents insist that all the signatures are exactly the sameâ€¦.come on guys, Iâ€™m human). Then he filled in my details as I enquired about when I would be getting my card to which he replied â€“ NOT MORE THAN 10 WURRKING DAYS. I returned back to my office and everything seemed fine. After around 25 days (WURRKING and NON-WURRKING), I finally received my card. I opened it with utmost anticipation thinking about how the card would look? What would be the credit limit? Etc. Then I was in for a rude shock!!! My Credit Limit was much lower than what Miss. Telephone had promised. It was infact lower than my salary!!! (I never knew there was life below that level also 8-|). Immediately, I gave a call to their customer care centre and asked them for clarification about the Card Limit to which they replied (nonchalantly) that it wasnâ€™t concerned with them. They said if I had any complaints I need to e-mail them at some address which they later provided. I mailed the responsible people enquiring about the same and they replied telling me to use the card for some time and that the card limit will be increased in around 6 months. I was fuming but I had no choice. I let the issue rest On 25th November, 2006 I needed (unfortunately) to make a transaction using my HSBC card (eeep!!!). Since I thought I could not repay the full amount in the following month I called their call centre on 27th Nov, 2006 and requested them to convert the amount to 6 months EMI. What happened next is not for the weak hearted. Please read at your own discretion. The call-centre agent told me that sheâ€™s taken a request and asked me to call back after 4 working days and confirm the same. I called back on 2nd Dec, 2006. Another call centre agent, Sangeetha (I started noting down names :-)) told me that my amount has been converted successfully to 12 MONTHS EMI !!!! I was furious. I told her that I had requested for 6 months EMI scheme and not 12 months. She said that the request has been made for 12 months scheme. She argued for 5 minutes. Then she told me that they will have to check out through taped conversations as to whose mistake it was; mine or theirs. (So, clearly it was a war now.) And again I was asked to call up after 4 working days (damn!!!!) Promptly I called them back on 7th Dec, 2006. And this time I demanded to speak to a manager. After another argument and a lot of hesitation the call-centre agent reluctantly connected me to their manager, Verisa. Verisa told me that as per Sangeethaâ€™s request they had verified whose mistake it was (about the wrong EMI conversion) and they had found out that it was not my mistake (PHEW!!!). She told me that a formal complaint has been made and asked me to ignore any statement I have received in the meantime and also asked me to call back after 4 working days to confirm the amount I need to pay in December(I hate the phrase 4 working daysâ€¦.absolutely hate it). On 9th December, 2006, I got a statement which said I have to pay around 2800 bucks including the EMI conversion fee and blah blahâ€¦ I did as I was instructed and ignored the statement. I called back on 12th Dec, 2006, (as requested). Preethi told me that I neednâ€™t pay any amount in December and I can start paying my installments (which had finally been converted for 6 months!!) from January. I felt blessedâ€¦. On 10th Jan I received my January statement and was shocked to see the billed amount. They had not only billed my monthly installment but also the 2800 rupees which I was told to ignore in December as amount due!!! I thought I will take a plane and crash it right into HSBC headquarters in Honkong (or Shanghai, wherever it is). I felt anguish for the first time in my life. It was agony, mental pain and it was the only transaction I had made on my HSBC card.I called them back on 12th. Another request was taken. Was again asked to call back after 4 working days (L). I called back on 17th. Matilda (interesting names they have down there) told me that request has been raised but they havenâ€™t received any update from the manager. I was again asked to call back after 4 working days. I was dejected with life by then, but I did call them back on 20th Jan. Sharath told me to give them some more time. I called back on 24th and finally an agent calculated and told me to ignore the January statement (!!!!!) and to pay only the installment and not the amount due in December. He also promised me that everything will be taken care of in the February statement. I have been waiting for the February statement with bated breath since then and somehow I have a feeling this saga is going to continue.HSBC and me now share an eternal bond and that too with only one transaction made.

I have been using it for only a couple of months now and have already faced many issues. The initial statement never made it to my home after a couple of transactions and when I enquired about it I was told that it was sent to the wrong address and the person at that address had returned it saying he doesnt hold this card anymore. I would have expected at a minimum that a bank worth to be called oneÂ will update its database with the new addressÂ when someone is offered a card that was used by someone else before but guys at HSBC dont seem to think that is required. So they happily slap a late fee, interest, service tax etc. for their mistake and dont even bother to send a new statement immediately to my address and give the details only after I call. The call center guy informed me during this call that since this is the case I cannot use my card anymore and I will be sent a new card and that the requestÂ was already putÂ in blah blah and it will be coming in 4 days, its more than 40 days now and still no new car has appeared. And meanwhile my old card is still unusable, that is not really a concern because I dont plan to use it anymore. I wanted to still pay the fine close to 500rs inspite of it being HSBC's mistake and close the card to avoid wasting time with their phone bankers because I am sure that even if I ask them to revert the amount these conmen are going to come back later with the same amount as has happened to some others in this forum. Now another pain starts, I submit a cheque a cool 6 business days before the due date and it hasnt been cleared at the end of due date. When I call up they claim it normally takes only(that itself is funny) 3 business days even for same stationÂ cheques and say will get back with the status by end of day everytime but they never do. I am pretty sure they are deliberately delaying the clearance to again slap the late fee, otherwise I find no reason not to encash a cheque even 1 week after dropping it. This is aÂ clear case of cheap fraud andÂ I shudder to think what happens to people who take credit or EMIs from them when they can indulge in such activities for a simple ontime cheque payment.

This amount was charged to my HSBC CC as they have a deadlyÂ tie-up. Anyway, some how I got the policy cancelled and got written confirmation too.But looks like the dumb people at HSBC are not aware of it.Even after my several emails and phone called, they keep on charging me for the Policy which I have cancelled. Every time so shamelessly they will Apologise but wont take any action.Its 3 months and I still don't have the issue resolved. I'll suggest you guys to use HSBC Credit Card, no doubt its good BUT DO NOT take any Tie-Up offer on it.It will screw you up. Beware from TATA-AIG, Daring Lyers !!!

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,4/24/07,User,2,"Have you ever come across a Credit Card provider that refuses to let you have credit? No? ThenÂ  welcome to HSBC Credit Cards. Here's what happened - because of a lot of reasons I could ot pay even a single paisa owed by me in Mar. In April, the new statement reflected the old balance plus interest plus late payment charges etc. My mistake, so I had decided to pay all the additional charges. Please note that my available credit limit was over 60K. I also used the card once. The second time I tried to use the card, it was declined. It embarrasingly happened more than once. I called customer care only to be told that my card was blocked because I had not even made the minimum payment in the previous month. I reasoned with them that the card cannot be blocked for the simple reason that it is a credit card and I have credit limit and I am ready to pay whatever charges come my way in form of interest or anything else. So what is the point of having a credit card if you cannot use it for credit. Of course, the poor representative went on harping about policy. Well, then the policy sucks. Credit cards charge a hefty interest rate and if you have a customer who ends up paying interest then let him. Why block the card? Secondly, how about informing me? As it is I got 2-3 calls everyday from telemarketeers. So why cant the bank, for a change, call me with a genuine issue and inform me about the action they are taking. After ranting about how other cards provide me good service and threatening to cancel the card and also requesting to speak to a senior representative, I was told that my late charges have been revoked and that my card was being unblocked. So much for policy. The sad part is there is no regulatory authority. These banks put up any policy in fine print and do what they please. There is no point having swanky 24x7 call centres if you cannot listen to a customer. This is my biggest bad experience with HSBC. There have been minor small ones in the past. The only good part is that if you scream long enough they accomodate you provided you are not being too unreasonable.",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New

Then I realised that they had cleared my cheque only on 03/03/2007.

Based on the above, I requested the bank to reverse all the finance charges and However, they refused to accept this . I tried hard trying to convince them that I am a good customer and the bank delayed on clearing the cheque. Thus frustrated, I made a payment on all the purchases that I had made and short paid the finance charges. Post which I asked the bank to cancel the card. HSBC then offered me a 50% waiver on the charges, which I did not agree because I had paid on time. I am a good customer for Citibank\ICICI Bank\Amex and deal through them.

As a result I cant get Estatements.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,1/17/08,User,1,"The tag line for HSBC reads'The Worlds LOCAL Bank'I absolutely, completely and wholeheartedly agree with this. HSBC is the worlds - LOCALEST, CHEAPEST Bank. Words such as **International Standards, Process Excellence, Customer Service and World class are alien and unknown to them. *This is what happened which made me adopt this stance.:- I applied for an HSBC credit card after their sales agent called me and was eagerly looking forward to receiveing it. I had to rather since their agent told me that I would get a GOLD credit card which has a limit range of 50K to 1.5L and that I would easily get somewhere around 1 Lakh Limit. Also the RATE OF INTEREST ON THE CARD WOULD BE 1.5%. And I jumped at this. So I gave my documents and signed the dotted line. The verification happenedÂ  and around 20 days later I got my card and the shock of my life. I had been provided with a CLASSIC card and the limit was a mere 53K. And the finance charges rate was a whopping 3.5%. To say the least I was bitterly disappointed and called thier customer care. A lady picked up the phone and I told her that I want to cancel the card I had received 15 Minutes back. She asked me the reason and then transferred the call to her senior colleague. I listed the reasons to her also . Specifically - The Gold to Classic deception the pecuniary credit limit and the rate of interest. This lady was very sweet and very smart. She said that Mr. Bhatnagar it seems that their has been some miscommunication but it is not an issue. You please use the card and in six months we would revise the limit on the card. I think I was asked to use the card a couple of times. Sweet solution but a very smart move I must say. The moment I would have used my card I would have been bound by the Card User Agreement and then would have paid the exhorbitant rate of interest. So I asked what about the rate of interest. Since this is not what was promised to me. Well she had no answer to that and agreed on the card cancellation. I also asked her how the limit had been determined on the card. I was told that this was based on my income documents which said my income is around 186, 000/- .[Doston mein bahut garin hoon! Agli baar udhar dene se mana mat karna].Â For the life of me I cant understand how and from where they got this figure provided that I had not given them any Income Documents. The documents submitted were a copy of my PAN card, My DL License copy and a copy of my other CC statement. HOW IN THE WORLD WERE THEY ABLE TO FIGURE OUT MY ANNUAL INCOME FROM THIS IS A MYSTERY THAT MYSELF AND I AM SURE THE INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT WOULD DIE TO KNOW ABOUT. Maybe they have some mystical ritual involving algorithmic procedures to arrive at this information. Now the interesting point on the Rate of Interest is that it was verbal so I can do two-hoots about it. You cant until u get it in writing and you will never get it in writing. The idea is simple. Hook the person. Let him have the card and make him use it. Once he/she uses it the person is bound and helpless. Â  Tell you what it is very simple for these banks to get away with this. The banking ombudsman rules in India Promulgated by the RBI seem too lax to me. You have to write to your bank and then wait for a month of non reply before you approach the ombudsman. Who has got so much of time? And with e-communications that all of us use this is long and delayed. So resultantly, these guys can easily do whatever they please before any action istaken.Â  For information sake I am marking a copy to the ombudsman also. NowÂ the bank, for the sake of it has a complaint redressal system and whatmore they have four levels of it. The only goodÂ  they can do is give you some sugar coated replies and not much. CAN THEY JUSTIFY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR SALES AGENT AND CAN THEY DELIVER ON THE PROMISE THEY MADE? No they cant because the moment I raised the subject of rate of interest they willingly agreed to cancel the card. SO MY FRIENDS THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THAT BEWARE THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE CONTACTED BY THE WORLDS LOCAL BANK.Â  Â  Regards Â  Pranab",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New
HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,3/6/08,User,1,"I am Soumendra Nath Thakur and a HSBC Gold (Visa) Credit Card 4476--7191 holder from Kolkata since last 3 years and I have been appreciated by your bank several times for my good repayment track. But I regret to inform you that on 04th of March, 2008, while I was checking my Bank and Credit Card Accounts status online,  I have found two unknown transactions happened in the statement of my said Credit Card, vide both transactions dated February 25, 2008 as indicated below. Accordingly, I have consulted the issue with your phone banking officers but the way I have been treated by your bank that can only happen in an uncivilized society but in no way such ill treatment can be expected from a bank like HSBC. My discussion with your phone banking executives made me to believe that your Bank's policy is nothing but exploitative and exorbitant, I did not find any reason how a bank like yours can jeopardize an injured customer when he actually needs your help and support. Your executive, after getting instruction from a senior manager, ordered me in an authoritative tone that I will have to pay for the said transactions even if they are not done by me. When challenged to refer the relevant charge slips (signed by me), it was then replied that I need to pay something Rs. 750/- for retrieval of two charge slips and also need to pay the corresponding service tax but before that I will have to visit the bank (in a distant location, unlike nationalized bank) and submit a signed in request form and wait indefinite days for the retrieval of the same. When I am 100% sure that the card in question can never be misused by anyone but it is only mistake (intentional or unintentional) done by your bank for the following reasons. However, instead of hearing my appeal for the help from your bank, your executive seemed to be treating me with a blind, prejudiced eye, and further ordered me to follow whatever said. The reasons, for which I am saying that they are not the transactions, can be happened in my card but a mistake of your bank, are mentioned below:- (1) Online, I do check my Bank and Credit Card account Statement regularly, and I did not find any approved transaction awaiting presentation even before that day while the transaction happened long ago, on February 25, 2008. (2) I also keep snapshots of all statements & valid correspondences and I am having them stored in my computer for future reference. (3) The Credit Card concerned has been kept unused in my locker since more than one month so it can not swiped to be misused. (4) The alternative way to misuse the Card is â€˜onlineâ€™, but that is also not possible as I always hide the CVV number by some sticker. (5) The other reason for that it can not be misused online that the Card is password protected by visa so if an unauthorized person tries to use it, will be declined for his inability to provide my personal password. (6) The payee merchant seems to be a reputed organization so the possibility is very less that they have misused it. (7) Following mentioned: systemic ascending order of the (concerned) transaction dates fails me to understand that how a transaction of ""February 25, 2008"" can come forward after an advanced date of March 3, 2008. Here my suspicion is raised and I have enough reason to believe that your bank has done these transactions either by mistake or intentionally to cheat this customer. So if it is a mistake, probably you are concerned about protecting your reputation (valueless) and impugned charging me to hide your own faults. The Statement *February 25, 2008 March 3, 2008 CELSIUS TECHNOLOGIES PVTÂ Â  INÂ Â  349.00 February 25, 2008 March 3, 2008 CELSIUS TECHNOLOGIES PVTÂ Â Â Â Â INÂ Â 650.00 March 3, 2008** March 3, 2008 14, 864.00 February 29, 2008 March 3, 2008 300.00 Cr February 28, 2008 February 28, 2008 100.00 Cr February 19, 2008 February 19, 2008 1, 681.00 Cr *Please note that soon after your bank has declined to provide me normal support, I have submitted a police complaint before the appropriate police station, providing the entire evidence, and I was assured by them to convert it a FIR if my bank declines to resolve the issue reasonably, in an economical way. I am sure, the above stated misdeed done by you bank will add another of several reasons for which I may hold your bank responsible for deficient, customer injuring service under Consumer Protection Act, 1976.

R. Bhanu Pratap, HSBC, Manager - Chargeback Operation, dated 30 MARCH 2008 regarding the disputed Transactions dated 25FEB2008 in the HSBC Credit Card No: 4476  7191. However, on perusal of the said letter and the enclosed photocopy of the document sent to me, it appears that the reason of the said letter is irrelevant and baseless considering my dispute, also the case reference transaction date - as mentioned in the letter - and the date of the enclosed document. The disputed and referred transaction date in question is 25FEB2008 but the enclosed photocopy of the document indicates the date as 25FEB2007, exactly the same day of previous year. Unfortunately, I do not find any reason that how a bank like HSBC can reply with such an irrelevant and baseless document. Such action does not reflect acumen of a manager that too from a bank like HSBC. Please note that, accordingly, I have converted the police complaint into FIR and now the onus of your bank to address the issue reasonably as well as legally. Its indeed sad that a Bank like HSBC India still can operate in this country, probably it is the reason that India is a dumping place, so whatever you dump that would be sold! - On 13/03/2008, info@hsbc.co.ininfo@hsbc.co.in wrote: Dear Mr. Thakur We refer to your email dated 11 March 2008, expressing concerns regarding your credit card held with the bank.

We would like to inform you that the bank would correspond with your directly on the case.

So dealing with a bank like HSBCÂ  is very injurious - both financially and mentally. They were not multiple billing but disputed billing indeed, the transactions reflected in my card exactly on the same date after one year from the date of actual transactions, so it raises a question how came a bank can reproduce a transaction exactly after one year when HSBC says, â€™â€™Please note that as the charges are processed electronically without any manual intervention we are unable to stop unauthorized debit to your credit card account.â€™â€™ HOW COME THEY SAY IT WAS NOT A MANUAL INTERVENTION WHEN IT WAS REFLECTED IN MY CARD ACCOUNT AFTER ONE YEAR?

But, my check never reached them! I was started getting calls from HSBC collection people. I tried a lot to trace the lost check but dont know where it wont. Finally I decided to stop payment for that check and pay them again. So collection people sent there executive on April 3rd.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,6/6/08,User,5,"I have been using the HSBC gold card since the last three years. Its my first credit card and so far the experience has been really good. Here are my major experiences with this card: I bought it on the first day after my last bill was generated, so that gave me exactly 45 days to pay it off. And as I had planned, I recieved two months salary in that period so I paid it in full and got a interest free loan for 45 days in the process! I bought most of my furniture on this card, again on the first day of the 45 days period. Again saving a a whole lot of money in interest. These days my life is more planned, so I put all my estimated monthly expenditure in a fixed deposit for 30-45 days, and use my credit card for all purchases. I know the interest rate is low, but any interest that I earn is ""free"" money, since the credit card is interest free for the 45 days after the monthly bill generation date. They have a fair communication policy and sms bill amounts on the bill generation date itself. And they are honest folks. Once I paid 10, 000 at the bank counter envelope and put the amount as Rs 5, 000 on the envelope cover. They called me later in the day and told me that I had made a payment of 10, 000 and not 5, 000 and told me they were correcting the mistake! If it were not for them, then I would have never found out about the missing 5, 000.(Umm.I am not that rich, but it happens sometimes, work load and all). They also accept cash payments as well at the bank in MG road Bangalore. That is really useful if you ever forget to make a cheque payment. I have used the facility more then once to avoid late fees. I live in bangalore so I use it for almost all my shopping. That means I get reward points as well for using the credit. I mean how good can it get? Get money for spending your money(from the fixed deposit) plus more reward points? I have used the card for some emergency expenses and have paid interest on it. The interest rate is high but thats what it says on the contract, so I knew how much extra payment I had to make, again my choice to use it. They did not force me to overspend. They have an online portal where you can track payments and expenditure as well as communicate with the bank via email. Its useful if you want to raise your limit, change your address etc. They provide reward points for every Rs 100 spent that can be used in many ways.

Yesterday I received a direct mailshot from the bank. India's not big on direct mail, largely I suspect, because nobody can ever find the bloody addresses. In the west we have postcodes. They do here too, but you also generally need to give somebody a landmark. So your address might read: Golden Enclave, 2nd Cross, 10th G Main, Government Layout 2nd Stage, Bangalore 560027 and then a little instruction: ""opposite the water tower, just left of the bakery. no, no, not there Dumbo, I said left of the bakery."" The mailshot ran: Dear Cardholder We at HSBC are committed towards building lasting relationships with our customers by offering them maximum value through our products and services. We have noticed that there is a fee-related outstanding amount on your HSBC credit card. As you are a valued customer of HSBC, we have reversed the outstanding fees on your credit card as a one-time service gesture. What's more you will get a 10% cash back if you spend more than Rs 1, 000 on your HSBC credit card before 30 June 2008. The maximum cash back amount will be Rs 500. However, should you choose not to use your credit card before 30 June 2008, your sanctioned card limit will be withdrawn in toto for security reasons. In case you no longer have the above mentioned card, please complete the attached form and return it to us in the enclosed Business Reply Envelope to receive the credit card. Yours sincerely HSBC Card Products Division. Well first of all, when I took the card out, there were no fees mentioned and as soon as a fee did appear I called the customer service department where somebody apologetically explained that there had been a mix-up and I wouldn't be charged anything. At that point in time, most of the charges were reversed but they've slowly been creeping up and I've just as steadfastly been ingnoring them. Mind you, HSBC in India is the same bank which charges you when you make a cash deposit. As for building lasting relationships though, they would appear to only last for as long as the customer uses the card. The message here is, use it over the next fifteen days or we'll prevent you from using it at all. Interesting too, that the enclosed form with all my details printed on it, encourages me to replace my card for one where ""the first year annual fee. will be waived [BUT] normal annual fees will be charged from the 2nd year onwards.""

Everything was fine till an unfortunate incident happened with me while my outing to Shanghai, China. My card was stolen and before I report it, it was swiped by some miscreants for an amount of about Rs.50, 000/- . It is this time, when I felt like leveraging my loyalties with the bank andÂ expected some cooperation from the bank. However I am deeply hurt from the response I did get from the bank. The bank simply sent me a letter saying that since the transaction was done before I reported the loss, I am liable to pay the charges. I agree to this in some way. However I informed the bank that the transaction was not done by me and asked for investigation. I asked to retrieve the payslip and check the merchants record. But to my surprise, the bank has least bothered to check on my request. I kept following up with the bank but everytime I did get the same response i.e the bank is not liable for any transaction before reporting lost card. Its been more than 60days now and the interest on the underlyeing amount is piling up.I am not sure about what to do now. But one doubt lingers me again and again and bit worrysome. Does this mean that when we are handling credit card, is it as bad as holding equal amount of cash, that anybody can get hold of it and swipe it out. If thats the case, then lets do away with the cards. Even after reporting within an hour of the lost card, the bank could not stop or atleast verify the transaction is bit unnerving.

Sadly, there is no information about this anywhere on their website.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,11/23/08,User,1,"Some three years back(2005) I was approached by Credit card agents of HSBC Bank who kept on following up with me till I agreed to apply for the Credit card.During the time of filling the application they had confirmed that the Card has life time free validity and I need not pay anything.They had asked me to Fill my name and address and took my signature at 3-4 places.I had duly received the Credit card and password in next one month. After 6 months I receivedÂ  a call from HSBC Bank that I have due payment toward Insurance policy accompanied with the Credit card. To which i clearly told them that I had only applied for the Credit card and not for any insurance policy then how come the Bank has deducted the money from my credit card without my signature and asked them to cancel the policy and refund the money.As per the bank authorities the Card was accompanied with a insurance policy and their agents had taken my approval over Phone for duducting the money.For which they have a recorded conversation.I had clearly stated that I was not interested in any insurance policy whose term and conditions, Premium amount, has not been disclosed to me and neither I had been approached by the Insurance company for any policy on which I had signed and authorised the bank to pay the insurance company any money..Nor did I received any policy till date.So why shall I pay the money and asked them to cancel the same and refund the money, for which they assured me that the same will be done. Again I got a call after 6 months from the bank to return them the money along with interest rate to which I again refused to pay and asked them to cancel and block my card so that no money can be further deducted from my card. I got a confirmation that the card has been blocked. Then I got transferred to other city and now after 2 years again I get a call from the bank and recovery agents to return the money along with interest for 3 years. I am unnecessarily being harassed for taking a credit card for which I was reluctant to buy from day one.The surprising factor is that I have never received any insurance policy either from the bank or insurance agency against which they are asking me to pay them.I am planning to go to consumer court now and also IRDA for this fraud.",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New
HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,12/5/08,User,1,"I took HSBC credit card in year 2004 and used it twice in Mid 2005. Both the transactions were made within a weeks time of each other.

I talked to HSBC people over phone and they told me that they generated one statement between these transaction. I asked for a proof of delivery which they could never produce nor they agree to revert these charges. Note that they didn't inform me about my billing cycle at the time of issuing this card. I paid the amount I used i.e the two transactions I made and asked them to either revert these Late Payment and Finance charges or start a legal proceeding but they did nothing but just kept on adding Late payment and finance changes month on month and finally made it Rs~16000/- and reported it to CIBIL. Note that they are not ready to take legal action but arm twisting using CIBIL powers. Looking at the harassment we have in legal proceedings I decided to pay this amount in July 2008. Same was paid and they sent me statement with 0 balance but never cared to notify the CIBIL about this. I tried to reach HSBC but they are not listening.

When I emailed them they wanted a scanned copy of the statement they have sent (!). Left hand does not know what right hand is doing. Not only that they would not bother to check with their own department. Second issue: Encashment of reward points. Their statement mentioned 300 points for a Rs.250 voucher.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,1/30/09,User,1,"UPDATE: I have cancelled my HSBC Visa PlatinumÂ Â credit card recently, because over the last two years they have beenÂ Â systematchandru021y getting more and more worse. None of the below mentionedÂ Â advantages really apply to HSBC cards anymore. Read more in my updateÂ Â below dated January 6, 2011. I was recently upgraded to a lifetime free Visa Platinum credit card from HSBC. Earlier, I had a Visa Gold credit card from them for about three years. It's a good credit card for the following reasons: Good offers from time to time(I've observed that of all the credit cards, HSBC and ICICI BankÂ Â come up with the maximum number of offers or discounts on purchases onÂ Â their credit cards. On HSBC, one regular good offer is the 10% cash backÂ Â scheme which comes around Diwali time each year and gives you aÂ Â discount of 10% on the bill amount upto a maximum of Rs. 1000). No penalties if payment is made up to 1-2 days late(It happened once with me). Good internet banking service(You can pay your bills throughÂ Â HSBC's internet banking and it will be charged to your card and you willÂ Â currently also get a 3% discount on the bill amount). Good customtakeouter service but funny sometimes(Will explain more later). Good security(They give a security device which generates a randomÂ Â six-digit number everytime, that you need login into or to pay anyÂ Â bills online via their website). Decent choice of rewards/gifts when redeeming reward points. True to their word(They circulate their Terms & Conditions andÂ Â follow them strictly, and don't put unfair or random charges on you). ButÂ Â recently there was a funny incident with their customtakeouter care. I got aÂ Â mail and a phone call from HSBC asking if I would like to upgrade myÂ Â Gold card to a lifetime free Platinum one. Earlier also they had calledÂ Â me for the same but at that time it wasn't lifetime free, and so IÂ Â refused it. But this time it was free, so I agreed for it. Now, all the formalities for the upgrade were completed. I got a fewÂ Â calls for verification that went fine. But then there was no news, evenÂ Â after two weeks. So I called up their customtakeouter care to enquire. The guyÂ Â talking to me said that there were some notes regarding the upgrade onÂ Â the system but no status on the same! So I forwarded the mail for the lifetime free Platinum card upgrade which they had sent me to info@hsbc.co.inÂ Â and asked about the status. They gave a standard reply that since theÂ Â Platinum card comes loaded with lots of features, they are unable toÂ Â provide it free of cost! They mentioned the annual fees, etc. below. The funny part was that right below was their original mail which IÂ Â had forwarded to them, which explicitly said that it was an invitationÂ Â to upgrade to a lifetime free Platinum card! It also said that I shouldÂ Â mail info@hsbc.co.inÂ Â for any queries. So I wonder if they even read the full mail properly!Â Â And how come their customtakeouter service executives don't know about theirÂ Â own offers? Anyway, about two days later I saw the new Platinum card number in myÂ Â online HSBC account, and then got it by mail a few days later. Even theÂ Â outstanding balance and reward points were transferred from my old cardÂ Â to the new card as promised, albeit after a few days. So no problem. But I must say this is a one-off case. Generally they are prompt inÂ Â responding and also answer the queries properly. So overall I'm quiteÂ Â happy. And the HSBC Platinum card is definitely a matter of pride to have! UPDATE: January 6, 2011 I cancelled my HSBC Visa Platinum credit card a few weeks ago. TheyÂ Â had been getting worse over a period of time, and in the last year orÂ Â so, they became so bad that I would literally get high blood pressureÂ Â every time I interacted with them through email, phone or any which way. Sample this: They said their card was lifetime free, but they charged me Rs. 4000 as annual fees twice, which then took about 3 months to get back after repeated follow-ups and numerous false assurances from them. Their customtakeouter care has absolutely become hopeless! They don'tÂ Â understand what the customtakeouter is asking and give incorrect or unrelatedÂ Â information in the reply. It takes couple of mails to get the pointÂ Â across. Most of the time, they simply keep repeating the old points evenÂ Â when I specifchandru021y point out that I am asking something else. ThisÂ Â caused me so much frustration! When I tried to redeem my reward points, the vouchers never arrivedÂ Â at all! After numerous follow-ups, I was told that the courier companyÂ Â could not deliver the parcel and so it came back! Apparently my houseÂ Â was ""out of service area"". This is strange considering there was neverÂ Â any issue with the statements arriving to my house! And then it was aÂ Â headache to get my reward points re-credited so I could redeem themÂ Â again! Not to mention, by the time I redeemed again, the gifts andÂ Â vouchers had become significantly costlier(in terms of points), so IÂ Â got a much poorer deal eventually. It is a big hassle to delete even billers from your account. Even that takes couple of mails to them to get it done. Once they sent a person to my home to collect a part payment,Â Â despite my claim that I had already paid it and it would be creditedÂ Â soon. They said it's just a safety measure to verify that I am notÂ Â charged late payment fees. Finally I saw that they charged me Rs. 100Â Â for the home visit, which was pretty useless in the first place as theÂ Â online payment was credited before the due date as I had claimed! Unlike in the past, there are no exciting offers or discounts withÂ Â HSBC cards anymore. So I no longer see the value of having it. There are a couple more points, but I'm unable to remember them now. IÂ Â should've updated this article when the frustration was fresh in myÂ Â mind!",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New
HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,2/10/09,User,3,"Most of us get calls from banks to take various loans. I hold a HSBC credit card for a good two years and was always pestered for a Balance Transfer. So one find day I took the BAIT. Until I took the BAIT, I had a wonderful feeling about the BANK im dealing with and this feeling lasted until I took the BAIT. I took the BALANCE TRANSFER as the interest rates were very low compared to the normal rates that a bank charges. But looks can be deceptive. What the cust. serv reps never tell you about is how they are going to charge the interest rate which u think I LOW. I dont want to waste the readers time and will like to caution ppl regarding this BALANCE TRANSFER. In a BT you hav options of choosing the tenure of the loan and accordingly you hav different interest rates for different tenures. And yes you hav a processing fee to pay(for the fraudulent csr's trained to CON u nd me). As when we use a credit card for purchases we normally assume that the interest will be charged on monthly basis, But when you take BT you will be charged on daily basis. Yes DAILY BASIS. The interest is calculated somwhat like this: BT amt(no. of days/365)int rate And if you make any purchases apart from ur BT those purchses will also be charged at the normal interest rates. But the thing is if u tak a BT pls dont make ne purchases coz no matter how much amt u pay first ur BT will be deducted nd den ur odr purchases will be deducted. That means you keep on paying exorbitant interest rates on ur odr purchases. Thats it my friends. Hope I save ur hard earned money. If u hav further ?'s do feel free to ask.

I had a HSBC gold card, on top of that they sent me one more card in good credit rapo. Then they started billing some Lifestyle repayment premium on the card, which I was not aware of, nor was I ever updated about.In Aug 2008, the very next month when I complained about the charges, the customer service guy sweetly said ""Sir we will reverse this off, dont worry"". I thought this was over, but it kept happening for the next months and the same process kept happening. Now after an years time of telling them the issue, their recovery guy calls me up and abuses me. He uses words like you an an Bhikari etc. I have decided to go to the consumer court and file a case against HSBC.I wanted to know if anyone has faced this problem before also, so that I can refer to the case. Also let me know if there is any other way to deal with this issue, which can settle this faster and smoother.But I am honestly telling all you guys n girls, dont ever opt for HSBC as ur bank. And you will be happy in your life. Update1: Yeah, I agree with you guys. Even I am HSBC credit card customer for past 4+ years, and didnt face any issues till this one popped up. I have a loan account that is running smoothly for past years. *Update2: * Now I have written to their nodal office, they have asked 5 days time to respond back to the issue. Today is the 8th day and there's no response, thats what I had expected anyways :) Update 3: Spoke to this guy called Kartiken from HSBC and he sent me a document that has some insurance papers.Its an TATA AIG insurance. The insurance forms are forged, its not my signature at all. I really dont know these guys are doing such frauds and why are they not being to the court? I am thinking what to do now, best way is to speak to the lawyer and get this thing sorted out. Update 4: Guys finally I have won this case, I just spoke to my the bank customer executives about forging my signatures. Also told them that I will file a police complaint against the bank for forging my signatures. In 5 flat days they reversed all the charges from the card. And I had been telling them the same thing for the past 5 months, this is how it works guys. You need to push these crooks and use their trick against them. The amount reversed was whooping Rs 6149.

After lot of heated aurgument He gave me the option to pay 1200 and settle the issue. As I was planning to go for Home loan and do not wanted to be on CIBIL blacklist I paid the amount. The a**hole had assured me that he will send me full and final settlement letter within 4 days but still I have not got it.

I had a card for which I properly paid bills and maintained usage for two whole years, but unfortunately one month when I was travelling abroad I missed paying my bill and they closed down the card abruptly. Meanwhile , trying to maintain my credit rating I deposited the cheque with them even after the card was cancelled and though I was out of the country. They said the cheque was not received for a long time and I deposted another cheque (my mistake) and they cashed both the cheques at the same time. The bill was for 9000 Rs, I deposited one cheque for 10k and another for 9k. Until this point I have no complaint against the bank since everyt othetr bank would have done the same. But all my efforts to either reenable the card so that I can use my excess balance or to get the cheque for the same pushed me to the limit. I made numerous trips to the bank branches, wrote so many emails, submitted so many letters to the managers. They never denied my claim since I had all the proof, but they never made the processing go through. I could sense this in every one's attitude, the person on Phone banking, the recptionist at the bank, customer support executive in the bank , the manager, noone gave me a satisfactory answer. Its been ten months ever since I am due. I still havent got my 10000 rs. I have raised a case with the RBI ombudsman claiming he money and compensation for agony.

Charging for(high) quality of service and products is not a concept they comprehend at any level . My experience with their credit card section though was much better compared with the bank. Largely I guess because I never really had to interact with them. They would send the bill and I would pay it in full . Hsbc bank is an altogether different story. They are the most inefficient, brazen, customer insensitive organization( not just in banking sector) I have encountered. Anyway I stopped using my Hsbc card several months ago .

When I saw the bill in the post I first thought that there may have been some unauthorized usage of the card due to which I have received a bill . I have to now enquire whether they have a piggy bank at the branch where I can drop a 1 Rupee coin to settle this o/s. I will allow them to keep the change. If the bank is desperate enough to print and courier a bill for an o/s of 79 paise they definitely need charitable contributions from customers( as well as get their heads examined .

This is ridiculesâ€™ how can my residential address have my companyâ€™s name, Mumbai address and city mentioned as New Delhi. I put in a complaint about this and asked the customer service to deliver the card at the branch. I collected my card from the branch after 3 weeks and didnâ€™t receive my pin till that time. I was asked to wait for a few more days and was assured that I will get my pin. I kept using my old card till then. My old card was blocked without providing me with a new pin. I went to the branch to check for the pin again. This is almost 2 months since the time I got the card. The pin was supposed to be delivered at the branch it didnâ€™t happen. I raised a complaint at HSBC fort branch for a new pin. I was assured that the pin will be sent to my residential address in the next 3 working days. Itâ€™s been 5 days since then I havenâ€™t got the card. I am not able to withdraw money. I called up the customer care again and spoke to Miss Ridhina who first of all needs to learn to talk to an irate customer. She informed me that the pin is now sent to the branch and if you want it to be sent to the residential address need to wait for another 2 days.

I already had an SBI credit card but went for this because they offered 3 year free(not need to pay annual fee). Since many have warned me about this offer and saw the same in many sites I personally called the customer service and enquired the same and they assured me that you card will not be charged any annual for free year . HSBC is now asking me to pay a sum aroung Rs.1000 as annual fee. When I go the statement I immediately called the customer care .I got the response that the rules have been changed when I further enquired they told that our card is an ordinary one asked them what they mean by ordinary and they dont have any answer for that. I wrote a letter to the manager here in cochin but go the response that they cant return the money which I have already paid. Even the manager was not ready to give a proper answer in his letter. So whats that in the promise they have given how can I believe those frauds? When I tried reward redemption and waited for the products for 2 months in between I called customer care more than 5 times always I got the response its on the way. Calling customer care is hell as it will take more than 10 minutes to get connected and have to hold for another 5 minutes to get the response , waste of time and money. After two months again I called and they give a docket number of blue dart called them and got the response that the items wher returned as there is something wrong with the address I asked them why dont they call to my mobile to which they had no reply. Again I called HSBC customer care and told them what the bluedart guys said they are not in a postion to answer for my query and told me to call back after 2 days, i checked my address with them and finds no problem(i am leaving in same address for the last 26 years) .i got really irritated and called them after two days this time they said we will give cash back in your next statement , what for the time and money I have wasted for this and if they have told me earlier I would have bought the same for stored here.

Now HSBC credit collection dept is calling me everyday and asking payments. HSBC is refusing to clear the dispute before 45 working days and no update available with their support centre.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,12/1/09,User,2,"HSBC cards had an offer for the period from June to Aug 2009. You were required to spend a certain amount within 3 months to get one benefit, and a certain amount within the first month to get another beneft. Another condition was that there should be a spend in each of these months. I spent the required amount, charged to the card, in June and July. I also had an ongoing standing instruction to debit my card every month. I did not have any spend in August, but the card did get charged for the monthly installment. However, the company is denying me the gift and bonus points that I think I am entitled to, claiming that the standing instruction debit is not a ""spend"".(Then what is it, pray?). They are merely using this as a technicality to try and deny cardholders what is rightfully theirs. I have decided to use my reward points and close my account with HSBC.

Then he started listing to my case and guided me to write an email to the info@hsbc.com. I had the same response that I am liable to pay the bill and nobody is ready to give me an update of my request to close the card. Ultimately I have no option but lodge a complaint at RBI Website and provided the complaint no. of RBI to HSBC. Immediately I got a response that HSBC is reverting off all my charges as they have been levied on my card wrongly.

It is the best of all other credit card companies in India. I really impressed with their prompt  response and patience to hear and understand customer issues. However, their operation team is a bit slow. Every year I need to remind them that there is no annual charges applied to my card. If I don't remind them in time, then they simply foot annual charge in the next bill. Every year I have to remind them and revert the charges mentioned. Other than this, every thing with this bank is perfect. I really enjoyed banking with them. I also enjoyed their reward programs as well. Whenever I had enough points to claim some thing, their customer care person used to call me promptly and let me know about it in time. I always paid my bill on time except on one occassion when the bank was on holiday continuously for four days. However, after I informed the matter with their official, they promptly agreed to my terms and avoided interest and other charges for late payment. It was so nice and they really exhibit the status of an international bank. As its advertisements says, it is truly a local bank, understand needs of local people wherever it is situated in the world! I would definitely recommend their credit card especially to those people who live in metro cities and travel abroad. HSBC credit card is a very good financial tool when travel abroad.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,2/3/10,User,4,"I am having two HSBC credit cards and using them for last 3+ years. I have more good experiences than bad. Below I will list down the pros and cons of having the HSBC cards: -----PROS ----- Good Reward Programme: HSBC have a very good reward programme. They also have good reward catalogue to choose your gifts from. During festivals like Diwali and Dusshera HSBC provides a number of offers like cash back and double reward points. Till date I have got more than 4000 rs cash back from both my cards and a number of gift coupons by redeeming my reward points. Good Customer Service: Till date I have received very good service from the customer care. They are always ready to help and also they provide relevant information about your queries. Easy online access: HSBC provides a very good online access to their cards(all leading companies do pretty much the same). It is a one stop online access for all your need for HSBC cards. You can see your balance, your reward points, payment date, bill date and much more. Perfect billing: I never ever had any billing issue with HSBC till date. Their billing process seems to be solid and accurate. -----CONS ----- No Payment using Site: Bad as it sounds. You cannot pay the bill using their online site. Even if you have online access to your card account, you cannot pay through that as the facility is not there till date. But yeah, you can register your card account in your savings bank account and transfer through NEFT. But it is much easier if you have payment facility like SBI card have. Delay in clearing cheque: I have faced this on two occasions. I paid my bills through cheque long before my due date but HSBC failed to clear them from my bank and those cheques were cleared only after the last date of bill payment. So, you can guess, they put good fine on both the occasion. Well, I had to talk to their customer service guys and they reverted the fines back on both the occasions. But then, I never want to go through this unnecessary hassles. Annual Fees: Even though I have a life time free credit card, HSBC puts Rs700+ every year as service fee. They do revert the charges back but I have to call them up or write a mail to revert back the charges. Ok, now I will put my recent problem with this card. I redeemed my reward points and as per the bank bluedirt delivered the items which they never did. After I raised a complaint with the HSBC card dept and two months of deliberation, I got the same response from the HSBC stating BlueDirt said the HSBC card that the items are delivered where as BlueDirt came to me and could not produce any proof of delivery and showed some fake signatures. Now, I do not mind much about the lost gifts as they were from redeemed points and I do not loose any money. But then, I have asked HSBC to cancel my card as I do not want to take service from some company which cannot protect their customers from frauds committed by their own service providers. I do have good relation with HSBC for last 3+ years but one issue and that hurts. So for now I am asking them to cancel my card and say bye bye. Overall, I have a good experience with HSBC and will suggest people to use the card carefully till they do not get into some kind of issue. If these things hurt a lot then better to stay away from them :)",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New

And, if the credit card is HSBC, then God help you! No, I guess even he cannot. I've had this card for several years. It's an albatross around my neck. My mistake I used it generously. Anyway, so I have been trying to get rid of the card for the last three years. Every time I cancel, they tell me I have been already charged for the annual fee and I'd be wasting Rs 750 so I can keep the card active, and they would automatically cancel it the following year. But, surprise! I get charged for it again and the story continues. Of course, then I need to use it. Ok, I'm not really a spend thrift and the usage has been for genuine purposes. But, you'd understand how it is; if you have something that makes things convenient, you don't want to go for the mehnat. Then, when I badly needed money for something, I thought I could withdraw from my credit card; but, my ATM pin does not work because I have not used it before. So, the customer care promises to send me the number and telephone Pin in 7 working days. I'm still waiting. It's been over a year. This month I have not received my statement because they are going green(I'm sure it's just a way to save their money). The e mail statement password does not work. They keep changing the payment due dates and my available balance as per their own whims and fancy. Then when I call, they ask me verification question and actually tell me that I must keep a log of my available amount all the time. Lol. So, now I will be unnecessarily paying them annual amount for the last 3 yrs. I still don't have my statement and ATM pin no. My outstanding is a bit steep. If I want a settlement, I'd have to default. Like, not pay for 2 months and they'd call me to cancel and pay up and then we could talk about settlement. But, I'll be charged a late fee and monthly interest. Does anyone have any idea what must I do? I plan to go to the bank on Monday and at least talk to them. Can I lodge a complaint? They would have recorded calls when I called for cancellation and they said, they have taken a remark and would cancel the card automatically. But, these calls are once in a year. So, how long do they keep the log? Would I recommend this to anyone? NO, unless I want to take revenge from someone or I'm in a sadistic mood.

True to that, I was not charged any fees for the past many years UNTIL on 13th April 2010, they charged Rs. 700/- plus service charges towards annual fee plus Rs. 350 plus service charges towards annual fee of one add on card. I sent an email requesting them to waive off the annual fees to customer care department in their email id info@hsbc.co.in on 14th April and I got a reply mentioning that there is no FREE FOR LIFE credit card and that there was some promotional campaign going on at that time, which is not there currently and I should pay the annual fees as above.

They responded saying I have to pay the annual fee as above and then can take up request for cancellation through different channel, by writing to their office address or talking to phone banking. I do not intend to make the above payment as I feel cheated by HSBC by giving false information and their deliberate intention was to cheat. My questions are: Why the annual fee all of a sudden on a card promised to be FREE FOR LIFE? Why the annual fee or joining fee were not charged in the past many years? Why was I not informed of the promotional campaign to waive annual or joining fee at the time of taking the card? What are the details of the campaign? Why was I not informed of the closing of the so called promotional campaign, if at all it were there? Why was I not given an option to cancel the card before levying annual fees? Why was I not informed prior to charging Annual fee. My calendar cycle was from 14th to 13th of any calendar month. Why was the annual fee charged on 13th of April, which prevented me to cancel the card prior to charging the annual fee, as it was charged on the last day of the cycle. Why was there no mention of the period for which annual fees are charged? I know of one instance of such levy of annual charges and on request, the same was waived off on 15th April 2010, stating that the fee is waived due to some promotional campaign going on now. That means there is some promotional campaign going on now. Why was that promotional campaign benefits not extended to my card.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/9/10,User,3,"  I was very unfortunate to be pitted against this cheat and fraud company called Heritage Holidays Pvt Ltd. through Plat5 Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. My mistake was of giving my consent to the premium Circle offer of HSBC banking upon the goodwill of HSBC. The bank debited me Rupees 6, 055/ against offers of 5% cash back, limited to Rs. 500/, a Polo Club watch and other other recreational offers. I got the Rs. 334/ cash back as promised, the cheap Polo Club watch(worth not more than Rs. 800/). But my fortune ended here.   I sent the vouchers for Air Tickets and Hotel on 25th March and kept waiting for the confirmation from Heritage Holidays, the company at the helm of affairs.   After a good two and half month of waiting I called the company to just be informed that my voucher was discrepant so they did not take action on the same. In fact I had given open dates to their discretion instead of giving specific dates. Instead of pointing out the discrepancy, the company opted to sit on the voucher until I called them to know the status. An arrogant â€œSorryâ€ was their reply to my question that if there was a discrepancy, why did they not inform me over phone or email about the said discrepancy. They asked me to send fresh dates and destinations. This time destinations were changed by them and my first preference of Jagannath Puri was removed from the destinations offered now. Same thing happened to air tickets offer. Initially they confirmed booking to and fro Mumbai with Go Air and Go Indigo but the return date was very next day to departure date. When I requested them to extend the return date by one day, they asked for a fresh schedule and this time they changed the destination from Mumbai to Jaipur. The taxes and charges were more than those charged by some popular travel portals. It could be assumed that the base fare was adjusted from the taxes and charges enabling the company to recover almost entire air fair from the customer. I declined there offer by writing that since they were not able to offer air ticket at competitive rate, I am forgoing my right to the same.  Now come to the Hotel offer. The company confirmed on 18th June the booking atÂ Â Hotel Vishnupriya, Udaipur, being my last choice for 6-8 Sept'10, which I accepted.  On 3rd of September, a close relative of mine, real sister of my daughter in law aged just 26 years succumbed of liver failure jeopardising my chances to leave for the travel. The same day I informed Heritage and requested to postpone the booking for about a week as a special case and rebook any day in September. But as if they have been looking for such an opportunity, they did not accede to my request. I had already checked from the hotel and they were agreeable to shift the dates provided Heritage confirms the same as they would be getting paid by Heritage only. When I contacted Heritage again on Monday, they disconnected the phoneÂ Â and switched it off just after knowing who was calling. Again when I called, the executive on the other hand was very rude, uncooperative and not ready to listen to me neither ready to give reasons for not extending the booking dates while the hotel did not have any problem in rescheduling the booking. Simply the company is run by inefficient, rude, unprofessional and fraudsters with a single objective in mind, to deliver minimum possible and to not to leave remotest opportunity to deny the offer at flimsy grounds.  The way the company set on my coupons for two and half months, changing the destinations at their whim, disconnecting and switching off phones put the company in the category of fly by night cheat and fraudsters. Such companies are badly spoiling the name of banks like HSBC(off course that of other banks too).Â Â So the banks must take due care in checking credentials of such companies.   Even if one looks otherwise and every thing goes well, there is nothing to get tempted with such offers. You can get hotel booking at much cheaper rates in the off season on the dates and destination of your choice. In that case you are not bound by the dates and place decided by someone else. Fifty percent discount is a norm in hotels in off season and you can bargain even further. Then you have the flexibility to change the schedule at your wish. You will seldom loose entire booking amount in case of rescheduling the booking. Contrarily under such offers you end up getting booking at cheapest hotels in the leanest season.   Same is true for Air Tickets. Who will like to go on a flight for which you do not have control over date, place and fare. You end up paying fare more than the prevailing market rates. Rest of the offers namely, Sport, Cruse and Amusement park are applicable to overseasÂ Â Sport, Cruse and Amusement, limited to reimbursement of ticket cost only up to Rs. 10, 000 each.   I was duped of my hard earned around five thousand Rupees, others can take a lesson from my episode. Everybody is advised to keep away from such offers.  Regards  VK  ==UPDATE ==:  I have been contacted by HSBC Premium Circle executive over phone and asked to furnish hotel booking request afresh, which I sent by email.  Now Heritage have confirmed booking of hotel at Puri over email and phone and informed me of sending the booking confirmation by courier.  I am of the view now that entire problem occurred at operation level at Heritage as they did neitherÂ Â hear me patiently nor let me get in touch with their higher ones.

After couple of months, HSBC reduced the credit limit to a quarter of the credit limit that was present on the previous gold card without any reason. Even though I carry another gold card with HSBC which has 4 times the credit limit of the platinum card, they refuse to revert back to the original credit limit. It appears they want to discourage platinum card usage. Further their policy on last payment date is very unfriendly unlike other credit cards. They charge the fines if the money is not credited within the last date mentioned. other credit cards give a additional time of few days after the due date for the check to get cleared.",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,10/31/10,User,1,"I had an HSBC Gold Card that was sold to me with the promise of being ""lifetime free"". When the card expired, they provided me with a platinum card saying the old card had been upgraded. Even though this was an ""upgrade"", they never cancelled the old card. Instead they levied an annual fee of Rs. 2000 on it which, considering the facilities the card provides, is astronomical. Needless to say I called them up and said I refused to pay. After a while they stopped sending me the bills for the Gold card so I thought it had been cancelled(my mistake). Then one fine day, an HSBC employee calls me up and threatens me that they will screw up my CIBIL rating if I didn't clear the bill on the gold card(the charges were the annual fees plus the interest accumulated - no purchases from my side.) When I asked them why they charged annual fees after giving it as a lifetime free card, the call center guy admitted that their sales agents are authorized to lie to make sales. They asked for Rs. 6000-odd but finally after some haggling they agreed to cancel the card and dues for around Rs. 1500. As an epilogue, the collection agent said that his company collects 15-16 such dues for HSBC everyday, so apparently HSBC is making good business out of this.",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New

They use very unprofessional, ridiculous language when you asked them to close you card account.

May I request you to kindly listen to the recording of this call(around 2030hrs IST tue 21st Sep), and call me with a solution. I should imagine you and your team would be able to hear my concern repeated 8(eight) times in this 30 minute call. looking forward to hearing from you before noon. thx To: rubysheriar@hsbc.co.in Subject: RE: Insufficient Service Support 21st Dec.repeated 12May Date: Wed, 12 May 2010 11:53:23+0000 Dear Ms. Sheriar, I had the displeasure of having to deal with your contact centre again, today. HSBC failed on the following counts: Mr Jagdish who took my first call, wanted to push some Healthcare down my throat, and confirmed this plan is given based on long relationship with HSBC. When I asked specifchandru021y if I needed to pay anything, he said ""no"". He then transferred my call to the Insurance desk Much to my surprise the lady at the insurance desk claimed that I needed to pay for the TATA-AIG health care plan. and all this extended discussion took place at my cost, as this is a paid line and gullible customtakeouters are trapped into disucssing the plan at length by assuring them that the plan comes at no cost. next I called back wanting to speak to Jagdish, and my call landed with Pramoda. at first she put me on a long hold to figure out who Jagdish was, while my phone bill was ticking. Insesitive would be an understatment, she went on to respond to two other queries that I had, but since the call is paid for by the client(and now I am sensing there is some kick-back HSBC gets from the phone service providers for dragging customtakeouter calls to make more money), she went on to push card insurance, whereas the query I had made was clearly for Life insurance. As if this was not enough, when I sought to speak to her supervisor she went beating about the bush in the following sequence. At first she said her supervisor was off today. not satisfied with the situation, I insisted on speaking to the Manager she said the Manager may be on a break, without even checking if one was availbale. clearly indicating a reluctance to escallating the call, thereby depriving me the opportunity to highlight any deficiency in your service. This challenge is reflected in my experience when I last contacted you Contact Centre, and no surprise then, that as a buiness you have not learnt anything from the earlier episode and as a business you lack the ability to fix things fast enough. I look forward to hearing from you in person as the last time my case was delegated to Mr. Ram Reddy, the outcome of which is clear from the abovementioned experience.

The customer care executive talked to me 45 min explaining all the details but after speaking such a long time , I told her that there are no benefits and I would not like to go for it .But see the frustration of the executive that on the despite my acceptance of the plan , she included the plan on my credit card in the back end system.They started me charging me the cost as a premium every year for 3 consecutive year .When I called them and said how come you can charge for which I have not agreed to , they didn't listen were charging every year .in the mean, there was credit card issue came in that I have outstanding of Rs 500 in my credit acocount along with iprotect plan yearly premium. When I know that bank make profits only from those people who dont pay their credit card payment in time , why should be I profitable to bank.Past 5 years all cheques was deposited in time and I always made sure I will not allow bank to make profit because of my negligence. When this issue came in where I have to pay the outstanding and iprotect plan premium for the card , I decided to close the account as going forward it can lead me into trouble in my CRISIL score .i know that there are no outstanding and no plans which I opted for idecided to call customer care of the bank but the bank where not taking actions where sending statement after statements .Then after 2-3 weeks of nothing happening over the same , I decided to take this matter to COMPLIANCE OFFICER . Many people are not aware that every bank has compliance officer who are responsible for the auditing of the operations happening in the bank. IÂ googled to find out who is the compliance offer of the bank and this is very easy to find as every bank has it .i mailed the entire concern to the officer and strong said that if the issue is not resolved at the earliest , then for me lhe last solution is to go to Reserve Bank of India (regulatory body managing all the banks operations ). The bank contacted the iprotect company ( which is third party company )to get this issue resolved .I got a called from iprotect saying that since I have never protested for this from past 3 years , why are you raising your concern now .That means if they are makingÂ Â me fool does not mean I have to be for ever and they take this gauranted for every customer. Twist in the story came when I asked them to send me the AUDIO recording where IÂ Â have said that I accepted the iprotect plan and should be included in my credit card .They really know if theyÂ Â have audio recordingÂ Â which I had with customer care executive does not proof that I have accepted the plan , they will be in soup . Finally , they did not have any reason not to go forward against me inÂ Â this issueÂ Â and took back the premium cost which I have to pay .But the issue did not got settled here, because the issue got resolved with 3rd party company only , with the banl the issue was still there for outstanding payment I had in my credit card . I wrote a strong mail to compliance officer to show me the proof of the day, date and cheque no where it got cleared beyond the due date .Again , they did not have proof for the same and I know myself very well that past 5 years I present cheque 15 days before due date .Finally , with no such proof being available at the bank , the bank has to close the account with zero outstanding ( I request for closure). Learning for all the citizens is that in case if you have any big issue with the bank or telecom and they are giving shocking numbes in your BILL , you can always fight by contacting to the COMPLICANCE OFFIER OR OMBUDSMAN respectively , provided you are correct and honest and really know that this cant be your bill in any case .Information on the various officers for bank or state waise higher authority is freely and easily available through internet.So dont get bogged down and fight for it .",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,8/30/13,User,1,"I am having HSBC credit card 3557. Having met the minimum spend amount of Rs 1 Lakh for a certain period, I am eligible for two zero base fare Indigo tickets anywhere in India before 31 Oct'13. The condition is that I have to pay the additional taxes, etc. This as per letter dated 23 Nov'12 from HSBC Credit Card division. When I tried to exercise my option for two air tickets to Jaipur from Kolkata, I found that although the Base fare is zero, but the taxes & other charges being quoted by Indigo is to the tune of Rs3500 per ticket. The taxes & other charges for a normal booking in Indigo per ticket amount to Rs700 - 800 only for Kolkata to Jaipur. This is a clear case of misrepresentation to the consumer. The HSBC managers are asking me to get the issue sorted from Indigo helpline, & Indigo is adamant of the increased taxes which is almost equal to the normal fare. I have written number of emails for the last two months & spend few hours talking to Credit Card helpline & Indigo helpline but to no effect. Any customer will assume that the taxes & additional charges for such offer tickets will be the same in case of anyone buying tickets directly from Indigo. But here that is not the case. From the correspondence, it seems that HSBC has not done any homework as to what will be the payoffs for each stakeholders for the scheme or may have goofed up. I am feeling that I have been duped & also feeling harassed. Is there is any way I can get justice?",MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New
HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,9/30/13,User,1,"I was offered a co branded platinum credit card (HSBC-MakeMytrip) by MakeMytrip. Since the offer looked good and I liked the service of MakeMytrip, I decided to go for it. The gifts that I would receive along with the card were two Indigo domestic flight vouchers which can be used for the waiver of base fare, International holiday coupons, domestic holiday coupons and a small discount on international air ticket. My target was to utilize the domestic coupons. The delivery of the card was promised in two weeks but it took a month with follow up with HSBC to get it delivered finally in June 2013. After delivery, when I called the call center to get my gifts and coupons, they told me that I will have to wait till my first statement. And they would deliver the gifts 30 days after the first statement! So I waited. After 30 days of the first statement as I did not receive the gifts, I called to check on the status. Now I get another shock. The call center staff informs that I did not use my card and hence the gift was not dispatched. Now I tell her that this is not mentioned in the terms and conditions and if this is the story, then I would go for cancellation. I made sure I got to speak to her manager. The threat worked. He promised that it would be delivered in 04 days. After 04 days when it did not happen, I called again to find the status that it will be delivered in 12 days. I registered one more complaint against the manager for false promise. With both the complaint numbers I emailed the grievance cell. They responded with a call and promised resolution in 10 days. I constantly followed up to see that they do not cross the deadline. They finally told that the gifts were dispatched. When I asked for the courier name and shipment no., they told that it is only ready for dispatch. But it did not reach me even after the promised 10 days. By this time 61 days had passed since I received the card. So I escalated the issue to the Nodal officer. The Nodal officer now promised to resolve the issue in 10 days. Finally on the 72nd day, I received the gifts. This was after numerous calls and at least 10 mails sent. But the flight vouchers were not delivered. This was supposed to come as a reply SMS whenever I SMSed for the vouchers. But when I tried, the voucher codes. I registered a complaint again. Then finally on September 11th, almostÂ Â 3 months later, they provided the voucher codes. Now on September 29th when I tried booking Indigo tickets using the voucher codes which should have given me a base fare waiver, Indigo staff informed me that the voucher codes entitle me to only Rs 500/- discount on the total fare! They told me that the codes for the base fare waiver is a different type. So HSBC cheated me by providing the wrong codes after so much of delay and number of complaints. Now I have taken up the matter with the HSBC Nodal officer who has promised to look into this. I clearly told that I have to receive the codes by Sep 30th as I have to make a booking for a travel on Oct 21 (as per the terms and conditions the booking has to be done 21 days prior).Â Â Finally after one more mail and 2 calls today, they informed me that they will resolve this in 10 days! Cheats!! I will have no use of this after 21 days. I trusted HSBC with the codes and believed that I could book a ticket and get a base fare waiver even if the ticket prices are high. Now I will have to book tickets at the original price due to which I will have to shell out Rs 3200/- extra. All because HSBC works more or less like a government organization and cares less about customer needs. And they do not give customers what they advertise and promise. With all the banks I dealt withÂ Â the worst experience was definitely with HSBC. Not once or twice, it is going on and on.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,1/23/14,User,1,"I used the HSBC Gold Card from 2000 to 2010. For 10 years the relationship was going fine till I paid my dues on time. It so happened that I was moving to a different city and the decision was so sudden that I didn't get sufficient time to pack my stuff. Moving from one city to to another after 10 years means a lot of work. In all the hurry I missed to make the monthly payment. Unfortunately since I had moved out of the city my cell no all seized to exist. So HSBC started calling at my parents residence who are senior citizens. My parents did tell them that the bank dues will be paid shortly, however they kept calling rather threatening my parents over the call every day. My parents were so harrassed that they told them that we would take you to court for harrassing senior citizens still they did not stop calling them. Finally, once I settled I made the full payment along with their hefty penalties and closed my 10 year long relationship with this bank. The worries did not end here, I wrote to them that I wish to close my relationship with them but still they keep sending me monthly statements. That's ridiculous. At the end of i, t all the banks are same. Until you do not default everything is green but if you default even once in 10 years the relationship turns into threatening calls. There are countries who have gone bankrupt and the banks have gone bankrupt but you an average citizen who pays the dues regularly is harrassed for petty amounts.

While transacting at branch one of their sales person offered me to apply for SBI Platinum cards with false promises such as free of cost and lot of discounts. Trusting SBI I applied. But to my shock when the card arrived it stated some onetime fee already deducted from my a/c. It said you shop for 10000 and we will reverse. I tried shopping but was not able to generate ipin as the sales person entered incorrect dob etc. It was impossible to talk thru call centre and neither branch people helped me.

SBI PLATINUM,Lifestyle,4/21/16,User,1,"Hey friends, couple of months ago I received a call from SBI credit card department as she said to me. She offered me SBI credit card with lots of extra benefits and offers. I rejected the call because I do not want to add one more credit card on my wallet. After two days she called me again with same lucrative offers I denied again. Next day she again called me and tried to emotional blackmail me as she said it is month of march and she had to complete her target and if I accept this it would be very good for her. She promised that she would give me card of limit 1 lac without paying a single coin. I thought if it does not cost me a penny then I should accept her offer. Then she told me about some paper that was needed for the new credit card. I gave the papers to a guy that was sent by her to my house. Next day I received some calls from SBI to confirm address and phone no. After a week I got my credit card it was platinum card. But the Limit was not even the half as promised to me. Fraud of SBI credit started Then in the afternoon I received a service call from SBI credit card this was male and he told some offers and insurance scheme in way that it were all free with my credit card. Then he told me to repeat "" I agree"" after him, I asked about price then he told me that it would cost me around 2500 rupees. It means that if I said him "" I agree"" at that time they would charge me 2500 rupees instantly without informing me about this. The Next FraudÂ Â On the same I received a call again from that girl who called me before and she told me that I have to pay around 3000 rupees as a credit card service charge but from that money I will receive coupon of the same amount, which I can use in online shopping. I asked her if I can pay this amount in installment she said yes. So till that time I became little aware and I called on SBI credit card customer service center. Here they told me when I deposit whole amount then they will provide me the coupon then again he told me that I have to pay this amount in single installment and if I will pay in two or three installment then they will charge 3-4% extra charge. I thought what the hell they all are talking about. They made me fool on false promises then they are trying to rob me instead. I cancelled my credit card because when in starting they are behaving like what will they do in future. In every step they fooled me. Guys please Beware from these credit card robbers. Do not trust on them otherwise all you will left with disappointment and frustration.",MOUTH SHUT,SBI,Old

The most common reason is that the billible cycle they have offered. My billible period starts from 8th of every month which is very inlogical as at time most of the salaried person do have major share of salary payment. Hence I am not able to full utilisation of 50 days credit as mostly Ihave been foster to use it on last week of the month. I have contacted to customer service for various time to change thebl billing date effective from 22nd to 25th of every month for which the due payment can be repaid from my next future 2 months from the current month. Suppose, if there is a transaction made on 26th January and the billing date is 25th every month hence the payment can be paid from April's month salary.

HSBC Visa Platinum,Lifestyle,1/30/17,User,1,"I have been using HSBC Platinum Visa credit card since 6 months. The Credit limit offered was very less despite having a very good credit score. The customer service has been pathetic. Customer cannot reach to the customer care executive at any cost. Very rarely, the bank offers any discounts and cashbacks. In comparison to other bank credit cards, this one is poor. Despite, mailing the customer care, we will not get reply from them and it is useless to wait for the reply. For an Indian mind, this card offers nothing. This card offers nothing for a minimum spenders. Only good thing is the bank offers 10% cashback initially and this one lapse in 3 month if we do not use the card within the said time. No cash back and discount on paying utility and lic bills. Rate of interest is too high. Along with that, if the payment is made with 1 day delay, the bank charges interest, late payment fee and other taxes. I will not recommend to avail this card.

The customer care never picks the call. the rate of interest are very high as compare to other bank cards. sbi charges a very high service charge on the cards.

They also waived the first year fee of Rs.10,000 using One Assist program and I have to pay Rs 3900 in 3 instalments. Thats a great deal! Compare this with Citibank credit card division which refused to give me a ""Prestige card"" even after me asking for it. They were stating rules for it that I have to earn more than Rs 25 lakh. The purpose of me asking this is to assist me in my international travels by allowing access to lounges. But unfortunately, Citibank never thinks. They do not understand that people in the category of earning 10 - 25 lakh are the most travelling group in IT industry. Above 25 lakh are all senior executives who travel less.

So after 30 days I got my card and I am very interested to use this as by using this card while shopping online I get many offers like a grate discount of 5 to 15 % on using this card. So I used it at many places but its major problem is that it is not acceptable at all places, so I am not able to get the proper benefits of this card. Along with that there charges for this service are very high , firstly if you have used for online shopping then you attracts services tax and if you used it otherwise than you attracts service charge and along with this service tax and charge you also have to pay for the banks services.

Today I got HDFC Diners Black card, upgraded from regalia. I have following doubts, requesting u to please answer..
1. Lounge access to addon card holders? Customer care person confirmed me that lounge access is only for primary card holder. Is there any charge to access the lounge as is in the case of visa/master card.?
2. How to use the card to access the lounges i.e. Whether they swipe the card or just have to show the card for complimentary lounge access.?
3. Whether Golf benefits are applicable to add on card also? Is there any charge for accessing the golf facility whether in India or Outside India?

I currently have an ALL MILES card with a limit of Rs.5,25,00 and a cibil score of 999. Yes, just checked it today, its 999 :p
Since the bank withdrew the PP on ALL MILES i was looking for an upgrade. The customer care told me that as such i dont have any card up-gradation offers on my card but i could apply via filling the form.
I hence filled the form and applied for the DCB. I also got a written recommendation from the BM since i have a decent relationship value having 4 preferred accounts (Family account) with the bank. 
Now i have three queries,
1. Will i be eligible for an upgrade directly from an all miles card to a DCB ?
2. I currently have a LTF card and have asked for the DCB to also be a LTF card. What are the possibilities for the bank to issue me a DCB as a LTF card.
3. Its already been a week that the branch has sent the application to the Chennai team but the customer care still says that they have not received any application yet. Is it normal ?",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

i have just been upgraded to Infinia. I do not have a salary of 40 lakhs and instead my gross annual income is Rs. 26 lakhs. if you would like to know the reasons for the upgradation, i guess the following could come in handy for anyone looking for Infinia. i have been a customer of HDFC Bank for nearly 17 years. i have also spent more than Rs. 12 lakhs with my Regalia during the current financial year. Besides, i work for the central government. my branch manager was of the view that Rs. 26 lakhs in govt is worth more than Rs. 50 lakhs in private sector( govt has no concept of CTC and instead every reimbursement other than salary is on actuals). btw, the limit that they have given on my Infinia is only Rs. 8 lakh. so i guess you were right on the money when you said that its the relationship that matters and not just the salary.

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,4/5/17,User,None,"Hi Siddharth
Inspired by your review, few days back Iâ€™ve sent my request to upgrade to Diners black. i had attached my visiting card and 2 month salary slips. Today, I got a message saying that my card has been upgraded. Iâ€™m yet to get the card dispatch details.
I was having regalia card with 6 lakhs limit (I dont have any other relation with HDFC Bank apart from Credit Card). I feel Regalia lost its charm once the reward point conversion was reduced to 60% from 75% and also when they reduced the number of free visits under priority pass to 6 per year. 
I was little bit confused between Diners Black and JetPrivilege Diners. Finally decided to settle for Diners Black as I already have an ICICI Saphiro Jet Privilege (although it is nowhere comparable with HDFC JetPrivilege Diners due to the ability to acrue tier points in the later). I feel normal Diners black can give the advantage of booking other airlines and redeeming reward points through diners website.
Iâ€™ll be missing priority pass, especially the acess to the travel Club at Mumbai Domestic T2

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,4/20/17,User,None,"I am from Ahmadabad so i will share my experience about HDFC Bank Ahmadabad,
In Ahmadabad, only 4 HDFC bank branches have imperia Banking facility, other branches are preferred branches only, so if you have account in any of the imperia branch then only will you get your upgrade, otherwise its tough,
My account was in non imperia branch so i was stuck with preferred account, i asked for upgrade to imperia but they never gave me straight answer, but one fine day i learned from hdfc bankâ€™s ex employee that preferred branch couldnâ€™t give me upgrade to imperia even if they want to because they donâ€™t have imperia RM, and if they change my RM to imperia branch(without transferring my account to imperia branch) then i would get imperia upgrade, so i went to imperia branch and talked to Imperia RM and he asked my Preferred RM about my wish to change RM and i was assigned new RM with imperia upgrade, Preferred RM was bit hesitant about letting me go as a client because RMâ€™s usually get incentives from the products they sell to us(life insurance, car insurance, demate accounts), but i stood my ground and i got upgrade,
PS, you have to meet eligibility criteria for imperia upgrade which are as below
Maintain a minimum Average Monthly Balance of Rs.30 Lakhs across all your Savings and Fixed Deposit* accounts.
OR
Maintain an Average Quarterly Balance of Rs.10 Lakhs in your Savings account. OR
Maintain an Average Quarterly Balance of Rs.15 Lakhs in your Current account",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

Each HDFC Bank Branch has one credit card guy who will sell you credit card, one Life insurance guy who will sell you life insurance and all other employees like branch managers and backup branch managers and Relationship managers and Cashier, and receptionist etc, so every branch manager reports to Cluster Manager, what it means is if there are 20 branches in Bandra, mumbai then all those branch managers report to Cluster manager,
In the same manner every branchâ€™s credit card guy has Superior, So if you live in Bandra, Mumbai then your branch will have credit card guy who reports to someone who is not Branch Manager, but we can call him credit card cluster manager, so when we make special credit card request for odd upgrades like regalia to infinia or floater card etc then those requests get sent to HDFC Credit Card Cluster Managers, some cluster managers are quiet relaxed about rules and some are not so one person on this blog may have obtained upgrade or shared limit credit card while other personâ€™s request might be rejected, so if your request seems to get rejected then try to move your account to another branch thatâ€™s at some distance from your old branch then make new request and u may have it approved, my infinia card was approved after moving my relationship manager from Memnagar, Ahmedabad to Thaltej, Ahmedabad, All requests are not sent to chennai for process and some are processed at you city only.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

so it could be my old credit limit of 8 lacks or it could be 80% if 10 lacks which is 8 Lacks, Tough to tell,

As per there website they charge Rs 100 plus tax every quarter programme fees same as preferred programme. It was waived off / revered last year after after written request.
Even after imperia member, no guarantee to get Infinia credit card. â€“ LTF.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old
HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,4/21/17,User,None,"Imperia program does not guarantee to get Infinia Credit Card but It certainly does help, Imperia RM usually has more authority then Preferred RM and he is usually more knowledgeable,
While I pay for 100rs + tax every quarter as program management fee for being imperia customer but you get lot more value in return, I will explain below.
100+tax=115*4=460
so I pay 460 rs every year for just being in Imperia program every year,
i get RENT FREE LOCKER for life as long as i am part of imperia program, I have the largest locker which my HDFC BANK branch provides, Locker rent is 15,000+tax every year and i get it for free, so 15000 saving against giving 460rs as program management fee, some branches also have locker that is huge and rent is 40,000 and its also free for imperia customer,
I also have demate account with hdfc bank, they charge 800rs or so for opening it but i got it for 499 rs so 300 rs saving there, yearly rent for demate account is 750 rs but its lifetime free for me,
they also charge 15rs every quarter for messegs received on mobile for account transaction like cash deposits and withdrawals etc and that is also free for me so 60 per year saving there
they also charge for international debit card but its free for me, premium debit card like platinum card cost 750 rs per year and i have it for free, there are no free debit cards with hdfc bank, they charge minimum 150 rs for debit card for non premium customers,
they also charge 200rs or so to replace debit card if you loose it or damage it but its free for me,
they charge 500rs to issue Forex Multi-currency Card but i got it for 250 rs because i am travelling to USA and it may help,
I also get preferential rate of intrest for all types of loans like car loan or home loan etc,
AND MOST IMPORTANT IS, IF YOU ARE HDFC BANKâ€™S CLASSIC PREFERRED OR IMPERIA CUSTOMER AND YOU SPEND ON YOUR CREDIT CARD ON WEEKENDS THEN YOU GET DOUBLE REWAR POINTS, SO MORE SAVINGS THERE(this scheme ended on 31st march but they may come up with new scheme in future)
SO your total saving is
40,000 for largest locker rent
750 for premium debit card
60 for sms alerts
750 anual demate charges
250 forex card
800 demate opening charge
200 for debit card replacement

All done in less than a week. Quite impressed. There was no verification call; just verification SMS.
Have a couple of questions:
1. Primary card PIN was set by calling a number. How to set PIN for addon card?
2. In the event that the card gets lost and needs hotlisted (hopefully never), how does it work with both primary and add-on card being on the same number? Are both cards reissued? I have read Amex is really good about quickly delivering replacement cards even internationally. How does HDFC handle this?",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

Today I got a call from credit card agent saying RBL is offering many cards and he offered me this RBL Platinum Delight credit card. All the points were same, except one thing which I want to share/ask. He said I can pay other credit card bills from this RBL Credit Card, to which I disagree and said only Net banking is allowed to do CC payments. He replied that you need to select RBL Bank in the list and then it will connect to the a/c linked to the credit card and then you can make the payment. Also he mentioned that this BT(Balance Transfer) feature comes after 3 months of activating and using this RBL card.
Please let me know if you have any info on this. I have multiple CC bills to pay.

After i gave the upgrade request on Thursday, I was unable to redeem my Regalia reward points(near 8k points)as the site was down(may be because of wannacry). I was expecting a loss of points. But to my surprise they have transferred the points in such a way that the value of points remains same. Eg 8k in Regalia -> 4.8k in DCB

SBI is one of renowned name in the banking industries, SBI has maximum branch in all over the country, and largest working people chain having in india. SBI also has some overseas branch which are performing good. If I talk about general banking like deposit and withdrawal SBI is good for it, But when we talking about essential feature and technology about bank its not up to the mark. SBI's credit card having higher interest rate as compare to other bank's credit card, if I shoppe in any e-commerce or any shop I unable to found best offer on it or any price discount on it, and also reward point is very few you will survive lot to collect reward point. Customer service is poor cause when you call them they hardly pic your call and you have to wait for them at least 10-12 min, after wait of that much time there is no guarantee if will provide solution from their end. They might be divert you to the bank personal. and bank staff as always not supportive with customer. I hope this review will help you to know about SBI credit Card.

But one thing which make me disappointed is that about there charges. There charges are very high as compare to other cards of different banks. They even charge different rates for local, national and international transactions differently which make it more expensive for me.

HDFC REGALIA,Travel,7/18/17,User,1,"I have had a horrid experience with my Regalia HDFC card. The card gives several special offers on 5X, 2X reward points etc - which HDFC should honour without the customer constantly pushing for it. I got a suspicion that HDFC wasnt honouring the reward point offers for their offers. I asked for a statement showing the individual reward points for each individual transaction. They refused to provide such a statement. So they were basically cheating and hiding their cheating by being intransparent. I followed up then on individual 5X, 2X transactions specifically with the customer service representative then. Here also they were moving to subterfuge- they gave generic statements saying that all reward points were credited. Then I mentioned the individual transactions. Then they checked and credited the reward points several months later, after incessant followup. Imagine how much cheating must be going on, regarding customers who assume that 5X reward points will be credited automatically, and dont followup / email the customer service representative, like I did. They make false offers, and dont honour the offers. Basically amounts to cheating and fraud. They expect the customer to go after them for the reward points and check specifically.",MOUTH SHUT,HDFC Bank,Old

Simply Save SBI Card,Rewards,9/26/17,User,1,So I have been using this card for a while now. the card provides you reward points and fuel surcharge features. Well I was really satisfied using the card but their customer service is not good when you compare to citi bank or american express. So my card was blocked because of the wrong pin and I called for the support. They told me it will take 24-48 hours to resolve it because our servers are not working. I told him that if I want to do a important transaction then what should I do. They said sorry sir but we will try to do it at the earliest. Moreover I told them to encash my rewards point in the outstanding amount they told me it will be done and it will take three working days. Its been 10 days I have not yet got any notification about my earned reward points. They should really improve their customer service and it is really hard to understand their support person.

I got this credit card for upgrade to my previous platinum edge credit card. Regalia credit is beneficial for luxuxy travels. Here are some positives and negatives of the regalia credit card. Reward points. You can 4 reward points for every 150 Rupees spent on your credit card which is a good thing. Because other credit card provide only 2 reward points per 150 rupees. International travels. There are many offers for international air travels. Also you get the access for lounge in airport for free till 4 times thereafter it is chargeable to 27 usd plus taxes. International spends. With lowest foreign currency markup fees, you can always save money while making online purchase internationally. Rewards points are converted into cash like platinum edge or plus credit card, but you can always redeem them for vouchers and buy products ranging your reward points.

The reward points we earn on spends are not at all competetive. Moreover, if you have hdfc debit card, through net banking, you can change CC pin anytime you want and any number of times.

But as I started using it I came to know about its drawbacks. First of all most of the time it was not accepted everywhere. I have to search for alternative options in spite of having this credit card with me. Second their support is not good. Their transactions take a lots of time to happen. The transactions many a times fail also which makes you very irritating as this wastes your precious time which could have been used in some fruitful work. And the headache of some alternative options of payment is just another pain in the heart.

They will play games of taking the disputed amount out of your outstanding balance and then add it back in your next statement. If you notice and ask why did you put it back, Customer service agent will tell you deduct the amount and pay for the rest. In next statement you will see finance changes put on top of that outstanding amount and you will be asked to pay not only disputed amount but also finance charges which would be steep.

Iâ€™ve recently started using the IndusInd Platinum Aura Edge Credit Card youâ€™ve reviewed above. Following are the details: Spending Limit: 50,000 || Statement cycle : 3rd to 2nd of every month || Due date : 23rd of every month
I have spent close to 60% of my limit this month (as I have transferred all my debit card spends to credit card to make use of the 50 day interest free period). And I plan to pay up the whole amount by 23rd of next month. I read that it is advised to keep our CC spends within 30-40% limits and not exceed else it brings down our credit score due to over-utilization. Therefore I had the following questions.
1. How frequently do banks report our CC usage to credit bureau? When would bank report about my usage? For my cycle, would it be 3rd or 23rd or some other date?
2. If I make full repayment by due date, would it still be reported?
3. If the utilization limit is to be indeed maintained, then should I make some repayment now to bring it down to <40%?
Thanks for your patience in reading through. I donâ€™t want to take any hit to my credit score and therefore want to take all the appropriate measures. Expecting a response from you ðŸ™‚",CARD EXPERT,IndusInd Bank,New

CITI PRESTIGE,Lifestyle,6/5/17,User,None,"Today, I did a detailed analysisâ€¦ and Infinia wins.
Both give you the priority pass bit.
Infinia points however are easier earned and worth Re. 1 each when you redeem them for tickets / hotels on the infinia travel rewards portal, which gives competitive rates and does NOT even charge the convenience fee!
Infinia has Golf and other privileges too.. like Vistara / etc. You can choose to trade points for air miles as well, but have the option.
Also, renewalsâ€¦. Infinia charges 10k (which can be waived off if you spend 8 lakhs a year â€¦ normally happens for people who are entitled this card and use it). If you do land up paying the 10k, you get 10k points which as I said is exact equivalent of 10k. rupees when booking on their portal. Prestige on the other hand takes 10k. and gives you 10k Airmiles = 2500 points of Re.1 each.
TAJâ€¦ Infinia broke its tie up , but hardly matters because one can always buy the Epicure membership with the $$$ saved and when you buy the membership, you get a free night coupon and few extra perks like 50% cash back on first 3 swipes. I did just that.
Foreign currency mark-up: Infinia + Regalia are the only 2 cards I have seen with a ONLY 2.5% markâ€“up, vs all others @3.5%
THERE IS ONE advantage of Citiâ€¦. In some countries where the currency is not normal, like Vietnam and Cambodiaâ€¦ most bank cards do not work. I had a friend stuck without cash. In such places, as was the case with him, he found a Citibank and they gave him cash.",CARD EXPERT,Citi Bank,Old

On my recent trip to the US, my card worked for a few transactions, then started getting declined. It wasnâ€™t easy to reach customer service â€” thereâ€™s no non-toll-free-number printed on the back of the card. Once I figured out how to reach them, after about 8 minutes of hold, I was told that I should first enable auto-debit on my card, only then they can enable it for international use. I was well inside my credit limit, and I donâ€™t like auto-debit, so I asked them if there was any other option. But that seemed to be the only way to enable it again.

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,6/9/17,User,None,"Hello, 
After reading your blog I called up HDFC customer care and had a lengthy discussion about the possibility of having dual cards, upgrading etc. Here is what they said:
1. For every card, they have a minimum credit limit. Like Diners Club Premium has 2 lakhs, HDFC Regalia has 3 lakhs and so on.
2. For Diners Club, your monthly gross must be 30% of the credit limit you are asking. For visa it is 40%. Not sure about master card. 
So lets say you want to go for HDFC Regalia (either new card or upgrade). The minimum credit limit is 3 lakhs. Since this is Visa, your monthly gross must be 40% of 3 lakhs which is 1.2 lakhs gross.
If you wish to go for dual cards, it is the same way. Lets say you want to go for a Diners Club Premium and HDFC Regalia. Then the calculation goes like this
Minimum Credit for Diners Premium = 2 lakhs => Gross required = 30% of 2 L = 60,000
Minimum Credit for Regalia = 3 lakhs => Gross required = 40% of 3L = 1,20,000
So total monthly gross required to go for such dual cards = 60,000 + 1,20,000 = 1.8 L 
If you have monthly gross more than 60,000 but not very high then I would say, go for a Diners Club Premium and for the balance amount get a HDFC Visa card like Allmiles since Diners is not widely accepted everywhere. That way, you will have 2 lakh credit limit on the Diners and a few thousands on All miles. You could use Diners everywhere it is accepted and for the other places, there is Visa.
Now if you are a corporate customer, they usually wave off the yearly processing fees. Also, this is how they calculate for salaried people at present. Not sure if this calculation will change in the future or how they calculate of the self employed. 
If you have questions or doubts on which card you are eligible for, I would suggest to pick up the phone and call up HDFC. After all, the more cards you take, the merrier for them. Via emails they are not very responsive. I asked for dual cards over email and they rejected it straight without a reason. But over phone, they explained me things clearly and could provide a proper solution. 
Hope this helps.
Thanks!",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,6/14/17,User,None,"Looks absolutely brilliant move from SBI â€“ I had been HDFC Premium Dinerâ€™s card holder for past 8-10 months, and what I am experiencing right now is due to the mandamus of payments bank based market sharing, more share for the digital transactions post demonetization, post mergers of plethora of mammoth banks, SBI is playing big in the market. I believe in 10-15 years down the line Credit cards are obsolete if not innovated, and in the time to come for them to exists, the demand has to be created, it is still quite prime to keep the elite cards in the wallet, just for the show off may be, but diversifying the segments like (SBI prime) will give others to think upon their strategy rather than devaluations. The inequality is rising & middle income groups are increasing and demand has to be met by the desires/needs.

However, I am still going to apply for this one. I am sitting pretty decent with my CIBIL score when I checked in March, i.e. 880+ something & I guess it should be approved if applied.

I am a salaried person working for a MNC company. I have been using Axis Bank Insta credit card (issued against my FD) since last 2 years. My CC limit is low. I went for this card as I have CIBIL defaults (Settled & Written Off Cards issued in 2007) in Past.Also, I have a running Used car loan from Mahindra Finance and I have already paid 13 EMIs. I have never defaulted payment in either of these currently running accounts.
In June 2017, I was looking for transfer of my car loan (from NBFC) to any good bank based on my repayment track record but by a DSA, I was intrigued into applying for a personal loan from Axis bank which was rejected consequently. The damage was already done to my slowly recovering CIBIL score.
In July 2017, my file was sent for used Car refinance loan to HDFC & Kotak. The Kotak has already rejected my case and the HDFC is still re-looking at my case ( As I have salary a/c with HDFC + but have a settled HDFC CC 6 years back).
Now my query all respected members is , since I am using Axis Bank Insta card since last 2 years + I have a Car Loan repayment track record + they have rejected my Personal loan application last month + 3 CIBIL enquiries in last 30 days , Can Axis bank give me any credit Card against their own Insta Credit Card? If not now then when should I approach Axis bank for a Card ? Also kindly advise some easy to get cards from other banks as well that I can get based on my existing Axis bank Insta Credit card / Car loan track record?
Thanks,

More over this card offers you best movie benefits, no spend conditions, no day of the week conditions, no 1+1 etc. By 2 or more tickets and 500 Rs. Are reduced from amount payable.
Trident & Vistara Siler membershup are icing on the cake.
And than there are periodic Visa offers like 15% discount on medicines at Apoolo farmacy ,& others.
10000 extra points if you reach annual spends of Rs. 3 lacs.
So even if you pay 5K as renewal fee, you get all the amount in cash back plus some. And Rs. 6000 worth of movies to top that.

My problem is i cannot open current ac (CA) in sbi as i have CA and cash credit (CC) in IDBI bank. As per banking rules if i have CC of 1 bank then i cannot open CA in other banks.

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,8/21/17,User,None,"Hi Siddharth,
Compliments on a great site! I have a query re Infinia vs Amex Plat travel as below:
â€“ My primary card is Amex Plat Travel credit card, which I have been holding since last 7 years (Amex KF before that). Annual fee was waived off every yr because of spend patterns (arnd 5L+ every yr) This year they are refusing to waive off, even though spend is 6.5L. I am thinking of cancelling this card as I dont want to pay the fee. I use the MR points heavily for air travel (Indigo) â€“ family vacations, and this has been a big reason for this to be the primary card.
â€“ Other card is HDFC Regalia â€“ used wherever Amex is not accepted. Guess the spend will be 1 â€“ 1.5 lakhs a yr also. This is LTF due to relationship wt bank, credit limit 6L. Have Priority Pass card, which is also used. However, not a fan of the rewards program and have not used it much really.
I can get the HDFC Infinia with condition of 8L annual spend (therefore no cost). Hence my question is:
1. Should I cancel Amex Plat travel card to avoid the fee (6k incl GST)? Will I miss the vouchers (now Spicejet or their own travel portal)?
2. And if I cancel, will the Infinia have similar or better benefits than Amex travel (I am looking at travel vouchers mainly).
Would be great if you can respond at the earliest, as I need to make a decision fast.

SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,8/27/17,User,None,"My Experience with SBI Prime Card.
1. They are very careless in handling customers, even if you escalate till CEO of SBI they will take minimum 15 days to resolve your query. Still waiting for my queries to be resolved.
2. Auto bill pay has very limited options and no guarantee that it will be paid on time. They goofed up everything on my bill payment and transaction didnâ€™t went through on scheduled date and I had to pay directly to provider to avoid penalty. After 5 days suddenly a transaction started showing in my account which actually happened 8 days late from scheduled payment. SBI is still investigating and no one knows what happened any why happened. Outcome is double payment happened.
3. Even if your grocery transaction is 599.86 you will get 50 points and not 60 where as my other credit cards take up ceiling in such transactions.
4. Apart from grocery stores ,reliance, big basket all other transaction give 2 pt/100 even if you swipe at POS machines in mall , My debit card is even better than this which gives 1% cashback on POS transactions.
5. Customer service is very poor and doesnâ€™t know answer of simple queries. I have 5 queries pending and for then 15 days minimum is normal time , before that donâ€™t ask for resolution.
20 RP per Rs.100 spent: Standing instructions of Utility Bills payments (5% Value) â€“ Not worth I found only 1 utility bill payment for which they goofed up everything.
20 RP per Rs.100 spent: All spends on your birthday (5% Value) â€“ This is good but yet to utilize it.
15 RP per Rs.100 spent: BigBasket, Reliance Fresh, Reliance Smart, Reliance Footprint, Reliance Trends and Sahakari Bhandar stores (3.75% Value) â€“ other credit card have good offers on bigbasket. standard chartered will give me 5% on reliance fresh. If this applies to Reliance Digital than its ok but HDFC running offer of 10% on reliance digital so overall not worth.
10 RP per Rs.100 spent: Dining, Groceries, Departmental stores and Movies (2.5% Value) I found Standard Chartered Manhattan card is better than this for groceries 5%, rest is good.
All other spends: 2 RP per Rs.100 (0.50% Value) no difference as almost all credit card gives it and their reward rate is better.
1 Reward Point Value â€“ Rs.0.25 (can be adjusted as statement credit) â€“ This is better but other credit card have better reward rate like sc manhattan 0.27, HDFC regalia 0.5 on regalia website else 0.30
SBI Reward Redemption Fee: 99 â€“ HDFC: 75, ICICI: 25, SC: 0
3000 Renewal fee and 3L spend for waver â€“ I would rather keep 2 credit cards which are either LTF or very less spend for waiver and still get almost every benefit this card is providing and sometimes even more when offers are running. And remember this card cannot match other card on online spends where most of people are doing transactions.
Overall in my experience and usage its thumbs down, may be useful for people who does lot of high value transactions.",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old

Thanks a lot for your reply. I asked my RM about the upgrade. She is saying, Regalia wont be possible. She is saying that your salary criteria does not match (they want NET salary above 1.2 L) and that moneyback cards are not even eligible for Regalia upgrade. Hence she is offering me Regalia First. 
However the hdfc cc rep at my office is saying he can get me approved. I do not know whom to trust. I really want Regalia badly. Is it worth taking a chance or shall I settle for Regalia First?

I am a great fan of Cardexpert.in.. It become habitual to me that i have a one definite visit to this site before sleep as well as morning wake up. Thank you so much to keep us excited and be updated always.
I am having Manhattan since 5 years having limit 2.6L. My monthly salary is 116k. I talked to customer today for upgrading to Ultimate. They were unable to offer me the up-gradation and quoting the minimum criteria for Ultimate is 3L on the card and 24L salary per annum.

INR 10000 cashback is for both Travel and Stay booking on MMT. Confirmed with the CC.",CARD EXPERT,Standard Chartered,Old
SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,9/19/17,User,None,"They have mentioned in their terms and conditions that there is a 2% mark up fees on foreign transaction. Actually that is not true. They will charge you 3.5% as mark fees when you will make the payment. Later on they will reverse 1.5% mark up fees, effectively making the markup fees as 2%!! They ave also mentioned that since they will be issuing cashback of 1.5% hence those transactions are not eligible for Reward Points. Hence you get actually no value on spending in foreign currency with your card. I am quite sure that even though theyâ€™ll reverse the 1.5% mark up fees but theyâ€™ll not reverse the extra taxes that theyâ€™ll charge on that 3.5%. So effectively, you pay more than all High value cards like Infinia, Diner Black, Yes First Card and Citi Prestige. You end up paying more mark fees considering the non reversal of the taxes on that extra 1.5% mark up fees and you will not get reward points on those transactions. Iâ€™ll stay away from this card. Itâ€™s not of much value to people like me who already have good cards. There is no scope for Annual charge reversals too in comparison to Diners Black which allows reversal on spends over and above 5lakh/year.",CARD EXPERT,Standard Chartered,Old

SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,9/25/17,User,None,"Just an update from my side â€“
I got my first statement today.
For total spend of Rs 10816, I have got 692 reward points.
The calculation is complex but it seems for several of my spends I did actually get the 10 reward points per Rs 100 which applies to dining, groceries or departmental stores. So, my guess is that most of the leading stores are meeting this criteria which is great.
So, based on this statement, my reward rate is 1.6%.
This is excluding all the accelerated reward points based on spend.
So, my conclusion is â€“ if somebody is using this card as primary card and annual spend is around 5L, you can easily earn around 4% overall reward rate and the renewal fee waiver.
But if annual spend is less than 3L, this card is not a good option as you have to pay renewal fees plus you donâ€™t get the milestone benefits.
I am happy with this card overall but the only problem is this is a VISA card and therefore, lounge access is limited to very few lounges in India",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old
SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,9/25/17,User,None,"I wanted to add something to my previous comment but there is no edit option.
So, posting as a separate comment.
I donâ€™t think this card is as great as I thought it should be.
There are a few issues â€“
1> If annual spend is less than 3L and you donâ€™t meet the milestone benefits criteria, the average reward rate is around 1.5% which is good but not great. You can get similar reward rates from life time free cards.
2> SBI is mostly providing VISA variant only. So, lounge access is limited
However, SBI sometimes runs good promotions on sites like Amazon or flipkart and hence it makes sense to have a SBI card. Since they donâ€™t have LTF cards, you can go for simplyclick or simplysave based on your need which has renewal fee waiver on less annual spends.
I think iâ€™ts better to go for Yes exclusive or Yes preferred card than this one.
I will most probably not renew this next year",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old

A bit of information about HDFC Regalia and Citi Premiermiles.
1. I recently got declined with both these cards at multiple domestic lounges.
2. HDFC Regalia priority pass access has become chargeable for $27+GST at domestic lounges. I got charged once already and they have declined to revert this.

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,10/7/17,User,None,"Hi Nilesh,
Frankly speaking I never cared for 30% of CL speding but always did due diligence while paying cc statement.
I used DR (initially) DP (later on) on every possible online transaction and fallback was icici coral.
Offline, apart from lounge visits(umpteen in number) theres not much of pos spread where diners shine.
Thank goodness, I have better ccs now (Yes preferred Ltf, amex mrcc ltf) as fallbacks with better rewardrate and markup.
I guess it would come around a lowly 1.5L spend in the year.
Did enjoy 4 free domestic flights (some 20k points under year long 10x)

SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,10/7/17,User,None,"Iâ€™d venture at least 4L. SC typically gives 85% of existing limit to HNWs, around 75% to others, provided it does not go over 20% of your annual salary. I donâ€™t know exactly how they define HNW, but if your existing card company declared your income over 30L per year on CIBIL, you get at least 85% of current limit, AFAIK.
Now, since this card requires a minimum credit line of 3L with SC, you need at least a card of 4L limit. Iâ€™d say be 5L and above to be safe. Of course, a salary of 20L+ declared with existing card company might be a requirement.

This site of yours is a blessing ðŸ™‚
Hereâ€™s an Infinia update (my experience)
1. I have regalia and diners black.
2. Previously when I asked my RM for an upgrade to Infinia, was told â€˜ITR less than 30L will not be considered. If its falling short by 5L or so (against benchmark of 40L) then RM can push for Infiniaâ€™
3. Since I was in the 35L ITR range I asked my RM to bump me up to Infinia.
4. Not possible RM said after doing max negotiations with credit card team. (I believe my RM).
Apparently HDFC now DOESNT consider anything in the range of 40L good enough to upgrade to Infinia. It should be 40L ATLEAST or I should give up my black to get Infinia. (Asked them to take a hike:)
5. Also limit enhancement when one holds two super premium cards is NOT possible.
(My current limits regalia: 2L, black 4L).
{Though I can see a 4L to 5L enhancement option in my account online & even received a call from CC informing of it.}
But limit enhancement option, for card on card for Yes Exclusive, too nipped in the bud ðŸ™
So thatâ€™s my Infinia story.
Like someone in Citi Prestige thread option mentionedâ€¦maybe time to either move from HDFC in toto and become a Citi Gold Client (with its associated pro rata bonus + renewal bonus via Prestige) or just move onto Prestige for now and wait out/work out for ITR to get Infinia friendly.
(Last weeksâ€™ news)

SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,10/20/17,User,None,"Nowhere close, but it depends on what you want. High end dining, this is leaps ahead of Prestige. If you want to hoard miles, there is no card on the planet that can beat the Indian version of Prestige, barring short-lived flash promotions. If you stay at 5-star hotels, Amex Platinum is where itâ€™s at.
This isnâ€™t really pitched to be a super premium card (even though it matches them in reward rate), itâ€™s really a great replacement for Regalia and Prime cards. Because it doesnâ€™t come with other privileges that come with super premium cards. Most privileges of this card are restricted to India.

A 299 transaction on Infinia would only give you 5 points, this would give you 9 points (a 1 re unrelated transaction would make it 10 points). SC calculates on overall bill and prorates it. Itâ€™s still not on level of Citi though, who even gave me miles on GST of annual fee. ðŸ˜› Apparently Citi gives miles on everything except interest and penalty charges and calculate it per bill, not transactions.

As I see in their T&C, â€œThis Offer is not valid on bus, railways, cabs and holiday bookings.â€ â€“ So cashback is applicable on Flight & Hotel booking

There is an important update, transaction reversal will not consider as a statement credit in SBI.
I made a booking in Yatra.com worth of 50,000/-. I cancelled the ticket and got a refund of 30,000/-. Total payment due is 70,000/-. So I paid 40,000/- excluding reversal. SBI didnâ€™t consider refunds and fined me around 3.5% on total due but not on the remaining amount. I raised a complaint. Waiting for updates.",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old

SBI Simplyclick card,Rewards,3/2/18,User,1,"SBI is fraud bank, which traps people calling with fraud calls. Beware SBI bank staff people will call u to give card details and finally spend money in your account. Later if you complain them, they won't even take a risk to investigate and recover the money from the merchant. Instead you will be the bearer to pay the money back to them. They dont even have cyber police to investigate the fraud transaction. They simply make a drama of investigation over the period and ask you to pay. This is a big scam from SBI and they dnt let you know the charges for late payments. In the name of reward point as exactly on your card, they will give you the details and trap you as they wish. Even when I called the helpline and did query on this, they give all sorts of reason where you are not satisfied and if you ask to transfer the call to supervisor or management of SBI. They dnt even connect to them. I really dnt know even if helpline guys play around people, it will be noticed by the bank. Totally the bank is filled with fraud staff, beware.",MOUTH SHUT,SBI,New
HDFC REGALIA,Travel,3/2/18,User,1,I got this card alongwith my savings account. Was told at the time of selling that the priority pass tht comes alongwith this offers free domestic air lounge access. Its only later when they charged me 2000 inr for my visit to lounge I came to know that its no longer offer free lounge. Upon contacting custoner care they said they had send messages and update on website. When I asked them to close my card account they demanded me to send a hard copy of cancellation form througgh courier. Disaapointed with their services feature and fraud marketing while selling card. I would never recomedn anyone to use this card as they charge heavy fee  for their services benefit. Wud recomedn icici coral instead . Hdfc bank is still living in 90s era. Where they ask u to send hardcopy of form to cancel card . Ask u to send email for reporting complaint even if they have ivr for reporting complaint. And their customer care wud call u and will keep on repeating about their ancient outdated procedures. Done with this bank.

HDFC REGALIA,Travel,3/5/18,User,1,"Charged around INR 10, 000 penalty for an error in payment I was not even aware of. The bank not only did not inform me that a default had happened of 8400 in an amount of 2, 20, 000, it charged me heavily despite me informing customer care twice that the non-payment of a fraction of the total due was due to that I had paid 10K before the billing while the credit message was received after the billing; just that the credit was done in back date and already included in the bill that was prepared. This is a basic human error and if the bank cannot understand its customers, I better not have them as my bank. thanks, but no thanks HDFC. Please have a considerate view that you charged me a penalty of an amount more than the amount defaulted that was only a 1/25 of the amount due. Is it fair? Anyway, I have stopped using my Regalia card since and have moved to my other cards. I liked my regalia card, but if the bank behaves this way, I am better not using it. Bye bye regalia.

HDFC REGALIA,Travel,6/23/18,User,1,"Hi All, I would like to share my experience about the so called premium Regalia credit card from HDFC 1) Regalia has the worst loyalty program compared to other banks, they have almost all useless partners for their program, specially if anybody wants to use their reward points at the outlet. 2) HDFC still living in the ancient age of paper world where they can not think of issuing E-vouchers which can be used at the merchant outlet, one reason could be they want to promote their partners flop online business, else. 3) HDFC has charged me for priority access and when I complained that I was not informed about the same, they response was only their partner priority will have the answers to my queries, so my HDFC is giving priority pass to their customers if they don't even know how to manage their partners. 4) There customer care service is generally rude and most of the time it is not useful. 5) Almost all banks, I have a very good experience with Citi bank, they all allow redemption of rewards points through cash by way of adjusting against outstanding but here HDFC premium card has no such feature, which also shows the intent of the bank to discourage people from enjoying their reward points. My recommendation will be to look for better options, lot of options are now available in the market now, HDFC is a big name but not worth a value. Regards Jitesh Tilwani",MOUTH SHUT,HDFC Bank,Old

SBI PLATINUM,Lifestyle,7/19/18,User,2,"HI, I am using this SBI Platinum Card from more than a year and it offers me 10% Discount on FBB fashion purchase. And was satisfied with the features and service, until last month. In my last months statement I have been debited the financial charge of rupees 623 plus 125 as tax. when I investigated on it, I discovered the following: I have converted one my expenditure into EMI's, and I accept to pay the processing fee and the interest. But after one month, I have been charged this extra amount as FINANCIAL CHARGES. when written to them they say: ""Thank you for writing to SBI Cards. This is with reference to your communication dated 16/7/2018 . We truly value you as our privileged customer and regret the inconvenience cause to you in the matter address to us. Finance charges: The Residual finance charges are levied at 3.35% per month plus GST(as per applicable charges), on a daily basis. The residual finance charges are levied till we do not receive the complete payment.(Hence, the same is liable to accrue residual finance charge for period between the statement date and the date on which full payment is received). Further, we would like to inform you that if in case the payment is not made towards any statement in the previous month, residual finance charges @ 3.35% is charged till the date the complete payment is not received. We regret to inform you that we express our inability to reverse the residual finance charges on your SBI Card Account."" According to them, when I opt for their flexipay service(like I did last to last month) any transaction I do there after will attract a financial charge of 3.35% until my EMI's tenure is completed. This is what they say written in term & condition, but my concern is why this charges. I am paying you the interest, the processing fee to get the transaction converted to EMI's. then why cant I enjoy the card for other transaction( On every transaction now, they will levied this financial charges of 3.35%) Recommendation to everyone, do understand every features or services offer very carefully.",MOUTH SHUT,SBI,Old

Literally, they are goons to rob your money. In month of Dec'2017, I received call from HDFC Credit Card division and they offered me REGALIA card. I wasnt interested as I dont want to pay annual membership fee. They adviced me that if I spent 1L in a year, this amount will be waived off. Again I said no. But they keep on insisted. Finally they said that membership fee(#HDFC #Regalia) will be charged at end of year and in case you dont like services, you can surrender it. They convinced me just first try this card. That unfortunately I accepted. But membership fee was charged in 5th month(May' 2018). I explained to them I cant pay this fees as this is clear case of misleading your clients. But sad there was no proper handling from their part and at last I had to ask them to surrender my card. Can you believe this ticket was created on 30th June and today is 6th August already, ticket is yet not closed and they charged LATE PAYMENT FEES on not paying MEMBERSHIP FEE. DISGUSTING! Few days back I got call from their representative to know more about the issue. I explained him issue again in greater details. I infact asked him to check call recordings(if they have). He assured me that they are going to call me back in 48 hrs. It's more than 48 hours(may be more than a week time now). Please resolve this asap.

CITI PRESTIGE,Lifestyle,10/26/17,User,None,"I had a long chat with my Citigold RM today to upgrade, and here is the criteria:
1. 25 lakhs in account (Cash, not NRV).
2. 40L ITR.
3. Internal limit (not sanctioned limit) of 6 lakhs and above for Citi cards 2 years old and/or, 10 lakhs and above for cards less than 2 years old.
The internal limit is something that Citi would allow you if you ask, or up to which they will offer you to upgrade on regular basis. Typically for 6 lakhs internal limit, the sought after income criteria is 15-20 LPA. For 10 lakhs, it is 30L and above. 
If any of the above criteria is met, their system will take the upgrade request, otherwise it wonâ€™t.
This card is not free for Citigold, only for Citigold Private Clients which require an NRV of 5 crores and above. Knowing citi, even if it is 4.99 crores on renewal month they will slap a fee. PremierMiles remain the only free card for Citigold, only if the NRV is over 75 lakhs in renewal month. Iâ€™ve gotten PM renewal fee slapped for a few lacs missing from my NRV, so Citi is pretty strict on that.
I upgraded to this card today. I had a PM card with 12 lakhs limit. They are converting PM to Prestige points at 45%, effectively 4X-ing my miles. 40K PMs = 18K Prestige points = 72K air miles. Otherwise, 40K PMs would have given 20K air miles. They charge annual fee for first year on pro-rated basis. So getting this card after six months of your renewal month will only have 10K fee for first 6 months, but you still get all 20K benefits. Which is a pretty neat hack.

SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,10/27/17,User,None,"Yes, I mean the Platinum charge card.
1.) You get elite status at major chains. Indian variant comes with even more than US variant. If you travel often, the $30 free breakfasts and late/early checkouts save a lot of money because you can then take cheaper morning/evening flights in and out. So elite status has capability of saving thousands of dollars a year. Also, since most chains only have premium variants in India (for e.g., Hilton has only one Hamptons, SPG has only a few four points), you canâ€™t do what you can do in US â€” earn status on cheaper hotels to burn on expensive ones. So this card really can help.
2.) Amex, a lot of times, can negotiate a better rate for you. Even if not, elite tier helps you there too. Amex is primarily a travel agency, never forget that. The card starting with 3 should tell you. ðŸ™‚
Keep in mind though that apart from elite status, Indian variant is significantly useless compared to US one. It is double the price, comes with practically unusable sign up bonus, points are 1.5X less worthy, and â€œDo Anythingâ€ concierge is not even in the same league as the US one. So know that they are taking Indians for a ride, and most advertised features outside of status wonâ€™t work as they should.",CARD EXPERT,Standard Chartered,Old

Because 10K airmiles with occasional 50% bonus offers from Citi get you 15K airmiles. Add to that 10K hotel vouchers, you get 25K benefit for 20K fee.

To come to your second part of the question, most of the hotel chains (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, IHG etc.) allow one to use a corporate code when booking direct (you will have to show an id card at the time of check-in). That has several benefits: reduced rate, free cancellation (up to 24 hours prior), free breakfast and wi-fi. If one is an elite member then one can club those benefits as well (so late checkout, lounge access, complimentary upgrades etc.). So my question is if one can club the Citi Prestige 4th night complimentary on reduced corporate rates then that is a winning combo, and makes a lot of sense who can avail the corporate discounts. Otherwise one has to do a cost-benefit analysis on a case-by-case.

For the business class voucher, getting even 2 redeemptions together was not possible. Hence requested for a premium economy redeemption. Having all these restrictions reduces the benefit .

1) Convert your points to AVOIS using promotions ( like 50%) . ( 2500 points*4= 10k*1.5= 15000k AVOIS )
2) Now donâ€™t convert /use AVOIS using BA as there rates are pathetic, use partner airlines. I was able to get a deal on Qatar airways business class germany to bombay by paying 16k taxes , same time BA was happily asking 35+k in taxes for economy class ticket
keep searching and you may get good deal
3) You can use 4th night free offer for many hotels, I used mine on Ibis as well as on Marriott. ( min saving of 5k-15k INR depending on hotel). (Marriott recently ran offer book for 2 nights and get 3rd night free )

3. How much credit limit you have ?",CARD EXPERT,SBI,New
Simply Save SBI Card,Rewards,11/17/17,Expert,None,"There are a few details that I want to share. 1st, each customer care representative gives a different information. The 1st time I called a representative, I was told that in my account I can only swap my existing card for SBI Yatra card or SBI Gold and More Unsecured Card (I donâ€™t know if it is the standard card that they are talking about or not.). And then I asked if I can upgrade to SBI Prime or not, then I was told that for upgradation, the account didnâ€™t show an option of SBI Prime card, however I can upgrade to SBI Elite as that is being shown. It sounded ridiculous to be honest. So I hung up and called another time. This time when I asked about swapping to SBI SimplySAVE, they said they can raise a request and Iâ€™ll get a decision within next 11 days. I was amazed as he said I could swap where as the previous executive said I could not. Anyways, I placed the request and the very next day I saw that the card in my account showed SBI SimplySAVE. So, I immediately understood that my swap has been approved. 
Now regarding why I didnâ€™t take SBI Prime. SBI Prime is for someone who doesnâ€™t have Super Premium Credit Cards or better who spends mostly on Utility bills. If thatâ€™s the case then SBI Prime will get you significant returns. The max return that you can get is 5% that is only on standing instructions. Other than that the returns are okayish. I already have Diners Black (3.33% returns on any spends) and Yes First Exclusive (2.5% returns on any spends) so it wasnâ€™t so much of a deal for me to upgrade to SBI Prime. Plus if you spend above 3 lakh in a year on Prime, only then you can get it for free otherwise â‚¹3000 plus GST has to be paid. I actually took it for my Dad who does offline shopping and hence SIMPLY SAVE gives 2.5% as CB. It made sense to hold this card. Hence the choice. ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™ll may be think of upgrading to SBI Prime when I have a big need to standing instructions like house rent and all. Letâ€™s see. And by the way, the CL is not increased. Only the card was swapped. I didnâ€™t need any limit increase as of now.",CARD EXPERT,SBI,New
Simply Save SBI Card,Rewards,11/17/17,User,None,"Even if your spends donâ€™t exceed 3 lakhs on the Prime card still the renewal fee can be negated with SI. For example, if your rent is Rs 15000/month and Elec is 2000/month on an average you can get up to Rs.10,000/- as statement credit per Year. Less the renewal fee of 3000 + tax. You could easily save INR 6000.",CARD EXPERT,SBI,New
Simply Save SBI Card,Rewards,11/17/17,Expert,None,Yes. I told you if you want to have that card primarily for utility bills then you can break even. However I pay through Diners Black which gives me flat 3.33% CB irrespective of any spends. So for me that card isnâ€™t of much value.

There is no single best credit card. The choice of credit card depends on how much you earn, how much you spend, where you spend and how much you save. Plus what do you expect your earnings on CCs (RPs/cashback/airmiles/discounts) to do for you. The good thing is, like in the case of investing for the future, to begin early and put much as expense as possible on CCs (I am assuming the rewards for paying thru CCs will be substantially higher than paying thru cash/cheque)

Which means points accrue faster in regalia than in elite as I dint need to wait to spend 3 lacs to earn 10k points. Meaning to say if I spend 2.5 lacs in 3 months , I would have earned 6667 points in regalia as against 5000 in elite and by spending another 50k in the 4th month only I would have earned more points in elite than in regalia (16000 elite vs 8000 regalia). Further in regalia I guess u can redeem points which is appxtly 0.60 ps to 0.75 ps (flight n hotels) per 1 point as against 0.25 in eliteâ€¦Which means regalia has more value than elite (5k-6k regalia vs 4k elite).
Based on above, on a long term basis is it better to use elite just for BMS and lounge while actually spend using the regalia to earn points (plus lounge for anyone accompanying) which has more value than elite ? Am I missing something ?",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old

Iâ€™v been using this card for 6 months. They are giving reward points for all the online transactions and wallet loadings. They are counting all the online transactions for milestone benefits. But, they arenâ€™t considering offline transactions for milestone benefits.

Not really. PM gives 2 miles/100 while Prestige gives 4/100. There is no problem in offsetting fee as they give freebies of 20K for renewal. Even for domestic, converting Prestige points to Etihad and then booking Jet is better than 1.8% reward rate of PM. On Prestige, getting 4% return is very easy. Getting anything more than 2% on PM is impossible.
Now, the Amex concierge you have is not exactly â€œDo Anythingâ€ version. Thatâ€™s only on Platinum Charge card. For Do Anything, they use Aspire Lifestyle as provider. Well, so does Citi Prestige. So in Prestige, youâ€™re getting same concierge as Amex Plat Charge Card. On Reserve, youâ€™re getting the Int SOS concierge, which isnâ€™t very useful. Prestige concierge has gotten me on club guest lists after 11 PM, while Int SOS was even unable to arrange a courier pick up. There is a massive difference.
You donâ€™t get any hotel memberships on Reserve AFAIK. Youâ€™re confusing the 50K Plat Charge Card with Reserve.
PM has its uses. For example, if your spends are less than 12-15L/annum, youâ€™re unlikely to be able to play miles game properly. In that case, something like PM or a Amex Jet card makes sense, where you just earn a few flights domestically and thatâ€™s that.

I am willing to pay for Prestige type of card and consolidate â€˜allâ€™ my spends on one card (both Diners & AMEX arent well accepted still and I land up using Citi reward card or Manhattan as secondary cards) but I still do not fully understand the â€˜directâ€™ benefit (read: returns) of the 20k+tax fees for the 10k hotel voucher (this part is understood) but the 2500 reward point isnt really covering the direct benefit, right? Some of you do find it worthwhile but I am still not sure. I do understand that 2500 points is equal to 10k air miles, but isnt 10k miles is far from the Rs 10k as returns? 
So do I conclude that there isnt a direct benefit (return) of the first 20k +tax fees but it is compensated by 4th night hotel offer, the airport transfer and lounge access OR am I missing something?",CARD EXPERT,Citi Bank,Old
CITI PRESTIGE,Lifestyle,12/19/17,User,None,"10k airmails can easily be 10k rupees if you know how to use them. If you book for J or F, it can be far more valuable than 10k rupees. Look at redemption options via Etihad, BA, Cathay, Alaska. Also, I am yet to see a card globally that can accumulate miles as fast as the Indian Prestige.
Itâ€™s only less than 10k if you redeem it for domestic carriers. You have to fly at least J to get to 1 rupee valuation.

Now I do not find this card good enough to carry on as no major vendors are available whose gift card can be purchased other than shoppers stop, Thomas cook to name few.

I upgraded to Dinerâ€™s premium in August after using Rewardz for around 6 months.
I saw that HDFC has removed Rewardz and Premium from the Product page (you only see them when you hover on Products, but not in the products page).

No ..All major vendors are gone.
Today count of options reduced to 17.
I got a reply from customer care and they simply say whatever options are there, we need to choose from them.
As per policy they are right but as per business ethics and customer satisfaction, this is completely cheating with customer.
While launching the card, they mentioned a whole bunch of list but within 3 months, the things are completely changed. What is advantage of paying Rs5000 + GST fee if you do not even have a good option to redeem. In first year, they are offering MMT voucher but what will we do of these points in next year? Even there is no option of fee waiver.

SBI Simplyclick card,Rewards,12/26/17,User,None,"I applied for this card online. Got approved â€˜in principleâ€™. But, I chose not to proceed any further. I halted them before the eKYC step.
As I read more about this card, some caveats began to reveal:
(1) Current 10x partners are: Amazon / BookMyShow / Cleartrip / Foodpanda / Lenskart / UrbanClap / Zoomcar. Ola has been kicked out of the party, which makes this card far less alluring.
(2) Rewards redemption fee is: Rs. 99 (alike HDFC). i.e. the Bank eats away 400RPs for no earthly reason. Although, some users have said they were not charged, but officially, there is this charge.
(3) Thereâ€™s Rs. 500 worth amazon GV as a welcome gift upon paying the joining fee, but no such GVs are offered upon paying the annual fee. Nor is it compensated by adding bonus RPs.
(4) The annual spending criteria of Rs. 1lakh for the annual fee-waiver is difficult to meet, specially for those who are holding multiple cards (since this card has no significant offline spending benefits, people would prefer to use other cards for grocery).
In my opinion, my Amex Membership Rewards Card performs better. I earn 1000RPs every month by spending Rs. 4000/- per month online (anywhere, including loading wallets, excluding utilities).

â€“ Based on peopleâ€™s experiences till now, is the 10X Reward Points on Groceries, Dining, Movies applicable on any and all Shops and is it the same benefit for both VISA and MasterCard Variant.

â€“ Do i go through the hassle of cancelling the VISA and reissuing MasterCard Variant, or VISA is good enough?

SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,1/2/18,User,None,"It is a money laundering issue for any US based issuer who has not taken W-8BEN/FATCA form from you. Basically, they cannot keep any money for any person liable for any kind of US tax. By crediting money to them, youâ€™re technically asking them to hold your money for a period. Typically this is solved by FATCA for individuals and W-8BEN for others, but Amex doesnâ€™t take either for individuals. Basically a US company (AEBC) canâ€™t use a foreign entity (AEBC India) to store money that is liable to US tax (Of person who is to pay US tax and has Amex card).
Either way, the way to solve this is to call them and tell them you need to make a big purchase. They either say itâ€™s fine, ask for bank statement or ask you to prepay certain amount.

SBI Simplyclick card,Rewards,1/4/18,User,None,"SBI has wasted my one full year! I first applied for this card on March â€™17 and one month later, I got an email saying that my application has been rejected because of â€œsome indeferrences in my savings bank accountâ€. Iâ€™m a government doctor and am filing my ITR properly, and I still wonder what they meant by that! 
Fast forward to September, 6 months after my first application date, I tried to apply again. Two weeks later and no reply so I called the customer service and after about 3 calls, got a phone number of this lady who deals with credit card applications. She says, that itâ€™s unusual to take such long time for getting the first call back from SBI and promised me to look into the matter. One week later, I get the first call asking for all the documents which I had already uploaded! I send it to them via email and then itâ€™s zip for another 2 weeks. I had to call them again! 
November first week, I receive a call from the head office and they have screwed up my office address including the pin code.. I have no clue, how they can do such unbelievable things and when I ask them to correct it, they canâ€™t! Next day, they somehow found a way to correct the pin code and told me that itâ€™ll be 526 rupees annual fee including GST and that Iâ€ll receive more calls from Gurgaon. 
After that, in the next two weeks I received 4 calls and all of them wanted to re-confirm my office address. Three months after my second application, as I didnâ€™t receive any notification, I checked the status online and you wonâ€™t believe this! â€œApplication denied due to pin code issueâ€

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,1/4/18,User,None,"Get Visa Infinite if you donâ€™t already have one. It is a tier above MC World, you get things like:
1. Visa Infinite BMS offers.
2. Visa Luxury Collection hotels. You get $25 food credit. This is similar to Amex FHR.
3. Visa Infinite Concierge. This is important because Infinia concierge is probably the worst in the country.
4. 2 stays to Hilton Gold.
5. Car rental discounts.
6. Access to Visa Infinite travel desk.
7. Discounts on meet and assist services.
If these benefits arenâ€™t useful to you, I would reconsider getting Infinia in the first place. If youâ€™re looking into it for Vistara Gold, Axis Vistara Infinite is a far better card to have. But keep in mind the service level that Infinia provides is bad and is not even in the same zip code as Citi Prestige and Amex Platinum. So it has never been a luxury card in my book.
Visa/MC wonâ€™t matter for forex rates with HDFC as HDFC buys USD in blocks and you get same rates, depending on when transaction is finalised. Most people who claim MC is better do two transactions one after the other and then compare.

Axis Bank Myzone Credit card,Lifestyle,1/13/18,User,None,"If you donâ€™t have a stable job or business (Iâ€™m not sure how youâ€™re defining it), Amex and Citi are not your options. I would have recommended PremierMiles as a good travel option. If youâ€™re otherwise well off, opening a Citi Priority should get you a PremierMiles card.
For quick card on card processing, SC is a good option. Although if your existing limits are low, expect a low limit which will likely never increase. But there isnâ€™t much for domestic travel. Your other good option is going with whichever Yes card you qualify based on existing limit. You might also into available Jet cards.
Since youâ€™re on road domestically, and you have HDFC and SBI, your emergency case is almost sorted. No other banks except ICICI have as deep presence to assist you.
My generic advice would be to not overload with less than stellar cards of a lot of banks who either donâ€™t allow multiple cards or have bad upgrade routes. If you get 4 joker cards, it will be a long time before you can get a proper card from the likes of Citi. This will also force you to then close your bad cards and that will affect your CIBIL.

They in all probabilities might have made this provision deliberately so that they donâ€™t have to pay accelerated reward points on SBI Prime Cards for those Insurance Premium Billers.

First time I am replying to a forum here. I applied for a diners black card post your review.

This is an exception for dc apparently. 
2 questions. 
They mentioned they donâ€™t offer dc black waiver to anyone for 2nd year onwards unless spending criteria is met. Is there anyway to get the card lifetime free.??

As far as I have read in their websites, carrier imposed charges and taxes need to be borne by the passenger.
In such case, 75000 skyward miles required for redemption is equal to 70000 rupees which will make the value less than 1 rupee.

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,5/8/18,User,None,"Hi,
I currently hold an HDFC Regalia and have been offered an upgrade to either the HDFC Infinia (Visa Infinite) or HDFC Diners Black by my bank.
I travel frequently and my primary attraction for getting these cards is that both offer unlimited lounge access across domestic & international airports. I already hold Visa Signature (SBI Elite) and a Mastercard World (ICICI) cards..so the lower acceptability of Diners at some outlets will not be an issue for me.
The the Diners Black has been offered free for lifetime, however the Infinia would be free only for the first year and renewal fees of 10k will be applicable from next year onwards. My annual spends on this card would be approx 4L hence I will not qualify for the renewal fee waiver on the Infinia.

This is one of the best cards at current times, Iâ€™m thinking it was poorly rated may be due to not unlimited lounge access.

I had posed a similar question here a couple of months back.
Siddharth had replied saying 10X for forex transaction will accrue.
I bought SPG points on March 17. (Billing cycle March 17-April 16)
Based on my understanding of discussion in this forum (that 10X for intl. transactions is credited in the same month as the transaction) I thought I would get 10X in March, if not March-April statement itself.
I didnt.
I called up customer care and was told I will receive credit in my April-May statement.
(My statement is due in a couple of days from now). The cc rep wasnâ€™t too convincing to be honest.
Will update here in case I receive creditâ€¦(Before that I should be able to decipher that the points that may end up getting credited pertain to the said forex transaction and not to some age old smartbuy/vendor 10x transaction ðŸ™

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,5/13/18,User,None,"Hi,
My take would be that you go for the Diners Black since the 10X program is unmatched by any other card. Also since you already own the premium variants of VISA and MasterCard, having a diners variant would be advantageous at times. I have been holding DCB for a year now and I am completely happy with it.
When compared to the Infinia, the only disadvantage would be the lack of unlimited lounge access for the secondary card at international lounges. My secondary card is accepted at all lounges in India but not abroad. Infinia provides unlimited priority pass for secondary card as well. But in your case you will end up paying 10K for the unlimited lounge access since you were mentioning that your spends wont exceed 4lacs and you will end up paying the annual fees.
Hope this helps",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

It takes 20 mins to connect to customer care,  and something goes wrong and you have to wait for 20 mins again. 2) Some of their phone representatives are pretty rude. 3) There is only one branch in Hyderabad, so we are very much dependent on their phone customer services which is pathetic. 4) I have been trying since many weeks to just change my address and it was unsuccessful. 5) unlike other bank these people put six digit pin so there is high probability you forget the number as other banks have four digits. I finally decided to close the credit card, god know how much of effort is that. My sincere recommendation is be away for this bank, as their phone customer service is inadequate and they hardly have branches.

I had a 6L regalia limit.
When I opted for DCB, they split it into 4L for DCB and 2L for regalia.
I would suggest go for the split offered.
Over time with your spend levels your DCB limit can go up substantially.
I now have an 8L limit on DCB alone. Regalia remains at 2L. I hardly use regalia.
Since you seem to be closer to the 40L requirement for Infinia, you can in due course upgrade regalia to Infinia.
My experience has been â€“ If one doesnâ€™t meet Infinia requirement but still wants it, they ask you drop DCB. 
Have fun with DCB while the party lasts!

Split your AllMiles 8,00,000 into two cards and get Diners Black with 5,00,000 and Regalia with 3,00,000 limit, The good thing about HDFC is that your cards will not be share limit and you will have separate credit line from both cards and your credit limit will increase in both the cards according to your usage,
Eventually you will have two credit cards from HDFC and both will have 8,00,000 limit so total of 16,00,000.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,6/13/18,User,None,"Hey, Siddarth. Really nice article.
I recently have faced a problem with Regalia VISA HDFC credit card. I got it around June 2017. Last month I planned a trip to Bali in June 2018. But when I applied for Priority pass, HDFC customer care replied that I am eligible for Priority pass only if I do 4 retail transactions within 60 days of receiving the card. Since I didnâ€™t have this information at that point in time, I had not make any transactions. Now I made 4 retail transactions and reapplied. But I dont know if they will consider me eligible.
Will I never be eligible for Priority pass till this card expires ? How do I get an upgrade on this card?

SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,6/13/18,User,None,"Hi Siddhart,
First of all, excellent review. I had also read your review before finally jumping to Diners Black from HDFC Regalia. I now got my hands on this Ultimate card from Standard Chartered.
Quick question: Regarding Airport lounge access, given this card is Visa Infinite, I assume users will get 4 visits/qtr on visa card + 1/month on PP (which is provided with the card) subject to 20k spend in prior month. Let me know if I am wrong here.
Interesting thought on wallet money- unlike HDFC, I think users will get the default 3.3% rewards for any payments liked to wallet account, like say Paytm. Suppose one transfers 1k to paytm wallet, user will get Rs33 as reward points (1Rp=Rs1). Paytm charges 3% for transferring wallet money to bank account (default charge for retail clients, business vendors have diff rates, mostly its free). This money (from bank ac) can be used to pay the same credit card bill, for calculation purposes, lets just say its 1k, which was used to upload money in wallet.
In short, will the user earn 0.3% (3.3%-3.0%)? Amount will be less, given Paytm caps money sent to self bank ac at 25k/month, but I think this essentially means free credit all round the year, while earning 0.3%
Leave it to the experts here to discuss further.",CARD EXPERT,Standard Chartered,Old

It had some minor clauses to achieve it but itâ€™s easily achievable. Though major downside of this card is it doesnâ€™t give normal reward points other than above written category.",CARD EXPERT,Kotak Bank,New

I applied for Kotak PVR Platinum credit card in October 2017 and it got approved. CL provided was 30K only. Later on I came across your blog â€œcardexpert.inâ€ and by the time courier person arrived for delivery, I refused to accept. Reason: as you have been replying again n again that reward rates of Kotak cards are horribly low. 
Though it may be good for some people more than other bank cards. One example given in your review itself. And just to explain you get 2 pvr vouchers with Kotak PVR Platinum CC on spending 10K only. But annual fee is 999/- + GST. And it canâ€™t be reversed in any case.",CARD EXPERT,Kotak Bank,New

Iâ€™ve been a Citi credit card holder since 2007 (had a salary account with Citi at my first job) and for years Iâ€™ve had the Prestige card on the top of my wish list. Slowly and steadily I upgraded my credit card to the Premier Miles card, which was great, but again, the Prestige was always the one I wanted. I thought it would be a while before I had a high enough NRV with Citibank before I would be eligible for the Prestige, but after reading the comments here, I just called up the Prestige helpline and they approved my application within a day! It was a quick call and they never asked for any documents. I think Citibank gives a lot of importance to someone if theyâ€™ve been a card holder with them for a while.
I had a credit limit on my PM card of under 3.5L, which stayed the same after converting to Prestige (gonna work on bringing that up next). All my existing miles on my PM card were converted to Prestige points at: 1PM mile = .45 Prestige point. However, the 4 times miles more than makes up for it, which is why I always wanted it.
Received the card today and made a few calls to their customer service, so far seems at par with that at Amex, but maybe itâ€™s too soon to say. So far so good.

Once KYC was completed & card reactivated three things happened with the card 
1) It stopped working for Online transaction requiring VBV (Error showing my mobile no. & email is not registered with bank post KYC)
2) My cash advance limit is now ZERO
3) My reward point balance is now ZERO
After complaining regarding online transaction block repeatedly they finally corrected the VBV transaction after 1.5 months 
But my cash advance limit & Reward points are still ZERO..
What can be done now with reward points.. Cash advance is not important to me since I never used it int he past???

After a lot of researching I went for an upgrade from Solitaire to HDFC Regalia First card 2 months ago. The application process and issue of the card was a nightmare and I would simply call it a bad experience. Customer care is pathetic considering I have had a HDFC card all along(7 years to be precise) and having been their customer. So much that I made up my mind to cancel the card and go for a SBI card.

Let say you are spending 9 Lakhs per year. You are not spending on 10x partners too, just for simplification.
By Spending 9 lakhs per year, You will get 9,00,000 / 150 = 6000 * 5 = 30,000 points which is equivalent to 30,000 rupees
Whereas in Regalia, you will get 9,00,000 / 150 = 6000 * 4 = 24,000 + 15,000 (Bonus reward points) = 39,000 points which is equivalent to 19,500 rupees.

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,9/28/18,User,None,"Thanks Abhishek, Sharathkumar and Balpreet for your response. Would be grateful if youâ€™d kindly enlighten me on a couple of other queries as well
1) My Landlord would like me to pay the maintenance directly to the society (association) and rent to him. Would such a thing be possible with RentPay even for the maintenance component or will it be exclusive to the rental component alone.
2) Is my understanding right that using the SBI Prime Card for Rentpay is most advantageous as opposed to Diners Club Black? My logic is as below. Please correct me if wrong:
SBI Prime gives 20 points per Rs.100/- on standing instructions for utility bill payments. So for a rent of 20,000/- p.m , one could earn (20,000 / 100 ) = 200 X 20 i.e.4000 points. Monetarily each point is worth 0.25p/- and hence 4000 X 0.25 = Rs.1000/- as rewards per month.
Diners Club Black rewards rate is 5 points per Rs.150/-. No 10X points for standing instructions. So for a rent of 20,000/- p.m , one could earn (20,000 / 150 ) = 133.33 points. Monetarily each point is worth INR 1/- and hence Rs.133 is the monetary equivalent of the reward.
Again, Iâ€™m new to this and may have got it wrong. Look forward to your advice. The differential seems pretty huge with the SBI Prime card ðŸ™‚",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,10/7/18,User,None,"SBI or any other bank donâ€™t charge any fee from the user or the credit card holder just like other similar billers. The 0.39% is charged by Redgirraffe itself. Effectively, by just giving up 0.39% you can earn 3.33% on Diners Black/Infinia or 5% from SBI Prime. I took SBI Prime primarily for all my autopayments like Rent Pay, Electricity, Insurance Payments. For all these, we get 5% returns. Itâ€™s really great to get money for paying utility bills and rent payments. With SBI Prime, rent pay can.easily help you reach your target of 3L an year to get the fees waived off and at the same time, youâ€™ll earn a cool 5% on all your autopayments.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

After this they give u 1% back on all international spends, thus making effective international markup fee only 1%. Add to it 3.3% points back, meaning a net gain of 2.3%.

HDFC DINERS CLUBMILES,Travel,12/5/18,User,None,"Well I guess devaluation happened sometime back in 2017 and then there were hardly any users of the diners credit cards . If diners need to expand their business in India surely they would keep the offers coming . Anyways if you feel anyday that the rewards are diminishing you can raise a request for transferring to regalia first as itâ€™s an upgrade . I am earning 5k points in the very first month due to a 20k + purchase on Flipkart . Converting to Vistara airmiles will give me a DELHI MUMBAI economy class flight ticket worth atleast 2.5k to 3k even if booked in advance . And for last minute travellers the conversion will work even better. To put the points into comparison , I have been using ICICI Jet Amex Coral Variant for the past 6 months and with their normal points program( no accelerated 10x type scheme ) have still not been able to get a Mumbai Delhi Flight ticket . Have approx 6k points now . ( Jet requires 8k miles for Mumbai & Delhi ). The point is this card right now on 10x websites is giving u atleast a 10% additional cashback rate over and above your normal discounts so you may go for it blindly unless this is the only card you own . Another rewarding card is amex mrcc though I guess your earning will be restricted to around 8k Amazon GV on 18k points or 10k statement credit for 24k points a year whereas with diners clubmiles 10x your getting 2.5k flight ticket a month converting to around 30k a year . However , Amazon GV or statement credit perceived value can be higher in comparison as the conversion of diners clubmiles into air miles reduces itâ€™s usage options to flight ticket purchases . So the real value of the points can differ between different individuals",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

I hold Diner Premium CC. Itâ€™s always my primary CC even for wallet loading and buying daily milk from Mother Dairy at 42/-. Most of the time my CC billed around 30K â€“ 50K/month and on September it was 95K. I have also offered by HDFC for Diner ClubMiles but ignore it straight away. On May (6 months ago from today) CC limit was increased to 500K through HDFC net banking (for card user only). Since that months, after every month statement generation, I used to check my card upgrade and limit increase from the drop down tab in HDFC net banking.
Today I was offered DCB with an annual fee of 5K, without losing a second I have confirmed the acceptance. Now status show â€œtransferred'â€. 
Now I strongly agree with the word of Mr Siddharth, there is no preset limit or eligibility in HDFC and they offer their super premium card to their good customers.

Another advantage is that Diners black has a spend-based waiver for renewal and normally the first year is free.

SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,1/10/19,User,None,"I have been using SBI prime card for the last couple of years.
Itâ€™s an excellent card if you dont have premium cards. A couple of years back when I got this card, I was using only basic Credit cards and this card seemed like an excellent choice.
Now, thanks to this site, I have 2 premium cards â€“ Diners black and Yes first exclusive which has much better reward rates for all kinds of spends. So, my usage of Prime card has gone down a lot. Mostly the Prime card is being used in local grocery stores and SBI specific promotion offers.
SInce the major advantage of this card is if you spend more than 5 lakhs and the renewal fee waiver is at 3 lakhs, I was not sure I will be spending that much.
So, I decided to downgrade to SimplySave card (only 90K spend for renewal fee waiver)as some of the SBI specific offers are very good and I feel everyone should have a SBI card (flipkart/amazon/makemytrip promotions). Called SBI customer care and they downgraded without even asking anything. The worst possible retention team I must say.
SO, to summarise, this card is very good if you dont have other premium cards. ALso, the birthday spend and bill pay advantages are great if you can utilize them (my bill payment monthly is only 2000/-)",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old

I was going through SCB websites & some other websites. Some of the Queries that come to my mind and could not find any answer in the above discussions are:
1. Since Ultimate Card Reward points conversion rate is 1:1, do the reward points requirement for individual items on 360 Degree Rewards change once I have Ultimate Card? For example, currently Flipkart Vouchers for Rs. 500 needs 1950 Reward Points. Will this change to 500 Points?
2. One of the card review site mentions 20% Cashback on Uber rides till 31-Dec-2020. Can anybody confirm this?
3. Are Concierge Services chargeable (General question for all cards)? I never happened to use this service on any card.

I called them to check and CC told me they donâ€™t charge anything itâ€™s the Petrol Pump swipe machine decides those charges, which I donâ€™t think was true.

AXIS PRIVILEGE,Travel,1/20/19,User,None,"Hi Sid,
Great initiative by you to put in so much of efforts into reviewing all these cards for us. An avid reader of your blogs.
Coming to Axis Privilege card, being a priority account holder was offered this card for free. However, I am holding the Axis Vistara Signature Card which I believe gives better reward rates (1 Premium Economy Voucher on spend of 1.5 Lakh, max 3 vouchers). Even if you take minimum Premium Economy fare between Del â€“ Bom (~4500), the reward rate would be 3% + ~1% normal reward rate, which can go upto 10% (I was able to redeem 2 vouchers for 1 week ahead travel date costing around Rs. 22000). Joining and annual fee is 3000 + 540 GST, but you get another Premium Economy voucher which is worth more. Though you have already provided a detailed review on this card, still putting my two words.
The only catch is limited flight options from vistara, though the redemption process is quite smooth. Plus the ambiance of Premium Economy (only provided by Vistara) is cherry on top. If you fly out of Delhi regularly, there wonâ€™t be much problem as Vistara has itâ€™s base in DEL. You need to plan for redemption in advance, which is usually the case with most airmiles redemption. Still I find it better than most of the Premium cards, as there is no specific requirement to spend at select merchants. All transactions except EMIs are considered equal.",CARD EXPERT,Axis Bank,Old

My docs were picked in Jan and i kept waiting and from Nov 2018 (wen first time i got the call) to Jan 2019, I kept applying online almost every other day, but no call, no response. Recvd card in mid Jan.
Very poor response considering that a customer is himself applying on your website. It took more than 40 days after i got the first call to get my docs picked up.
When the executive visited me in Jan 2019, he told me that reversal of first year fee on spending 25,000 in 45 days is not applicable, as the offer ended in Nov 2018.
I was sad, but since i made up my mind, i went ahead and gave my docs.
After i received the card, i spoke to customer care few times for reversal, they all gave same reply that this offer is not applicable to me (even if it was their fault in taking 40 days to pick my docs, because of which i missed the offer which was told to me on first call).
I used their chat window for chating with customer care, during which i told him to check how many times i made online application between mid Nov 2018 and Jan 2019, and no action was taken by them from Nov 2018 to Jan 2019.
I saved the chat and took request no. (do take request no.) for my request, saying that as a one time gesture they shud give me this offer and hoped for the best.
After following for more than 15-20 days, finally on 15th Feb they confirmed that they would reverse my annual fee for first year.
They once again confirmed that on spending 4L in a year, next year annual fee would be waived off, but customer has to request after spending 4L, it wont happen automatically. (Expected from Axis)

My main reason for which i zeroed axis card is for LIC payment on their website as it does not charges convenience fee. Visa and Mastercard limit max payment in one shot to 1Lakh, amex allowes any amount but charges convenience fee. As my amount is more than 1Lakh i had to had axis or amex, but Amex MRCC(which i have, thanks to cardexpert.in & Sid) wasnt giving points on insurance and charging convenience fee so Axis was the only option left.",CARD EXPERT,Axis Bank,Old

The markup is 3.5% +tax. And you normally get 1 reward point per Rs 100 spent. (conversion of 1 point = 4 air miles)
By default, any Foreign transaction earns you 2 points per Rs 100 spent. That means 8 miles per Rs 100 spent or 8% earn rate, assuming 1 mile is equal to 1 rupee. And after deducting 8%- 3.5%= 4.5%.

SC MANHATTAN,Rewards,2/17/19,User,None,"Just imagine who would give you a cashback of 5% when you pay for your monthly Bill at the local grocery store (milk, bread n eggs). Once can earn upto a max of Rs.6000 cashback every year. Plus if you spend 1.4 k (where you would spend 1.2 on groceries for the cashback), you would be eligible for annual fee waiver. 
Till now these are the stores where I have got a cashback â€“
1. My local Kirana store ( I run a monthly bill with him and pay by credit card twice a month)
2. Natures Basket, Fine Foods, Freshmart (havenâ€™t tried it at Big Basket as there are so many Paytm and HDFC offers)
3. Department Stores â€“ Bombay Store, Westside, FabIndia, Wranglers, Zodiac
The only hitch is you that can get maximum upto Rs. 150 cashback per transaction and the minimum transaction amount has to be Rs.1000/-. So even if you spend 4000 in one go, you will only get a cashback of Rs.150 (instead of 200 as per 5% cashback). Maximum cashback is Rs. 500 per month (1 â€“ end of the month). 
I also love the reward point system of SC. They showcase points / cashback earned for each and every transaction. (a facility which I truly miss in HDFC).

Its not 5X, its 3X and first you have to get registered by sending a SMS on the mobile number provided.

SBI PRIME,Lifestyle,3/5/19,User,None,"Hi,
Though Iâ€™m using this card for almost 1 1/2 year and been quite happy with its reward program but a recent bitter experience washed away all the befits I rendered from this card. So I though thisâ€™ll be a good platform to bring forth the awareness.
Simply put, my SBI PRIME Credit Card got cloned somewhere, somehow even though, I NEVER used it ever at any UN-trusted location.
Now this cloned card was used to withdraw money from an ATM and as soon as I received the SMS I immediately got the card blocked and raised a dispute.
I was told that the resolution may take 120 days and on my repeated followup they did temporary credit of Rs 15000 excluding the ATM charges. Now I got a mail from them stating that the ATM log shows the transaction was done (obviously) and I have to pay the money that I never took.
All said and done I just want to request all the users to be very careful while using this card because if any fraud happens, there are high chances that you have to bear the loss as the investigation team hardly investigates anything and there are many loopholes in their security.
Also if you still want to use this card I would suggest to get rid of cash limit available as most of us hardly use these credit cards for cash.",CARD EXPERT,SBI,Old

Hello Sir
I need to bring to your attention towards the fraudulent activities carried by Standard Chartered Credit Card department. They deliberating stop sending the statements on mail and on alert messages. As most of the users depend on mails and alerts as reminder for the payment, they fail to make payment on time, which gives an opportunity to the bank to charge heavy penalty added up with GST and other type of interest. They are not even considering the past payment record of the user and have a deaf ear to the request for reimbursement.
I was holding this card from past eight years and seldom have i missed on my payments. Their employee Mamta Phone Number-8039819800 behaved very badly and rejected all my requests.

SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,3/7/19,User,None,"I am following this blog since a long time and Thanks to Siddarth. By the courtesy of this site my cards are upgraded from a long back Allmiles to â€“ DCB, and also hold YFP, and few others.
Why should you go to this card if you already hold DCB. ?
As you are aware of the fact that you will get worth 33% rewards on transactions on either Amazon or Flipkart through smartbuy in the form of rewards.
So the real value of your 10000 cash back, if redeemed for Amazon or flipkart is RS. 6666 only. ( just imagine if you purchased the same product worth 10000 with your DCB card and you get back worth Rs.3333 in the form of rewards). And you are paying about Rs.5900 as joining fees. And while booking on MMT you will end up paying some convenience fees etc. so there is no real joining benefit.
The same calculation for renewal also. Out of Rs.5900 you pay, you are getting 5000 rewards worth Rs.5000. If you buy a product with DCB for Rs.5000 you will get back rewards worth Rs.1650 reducing the price you pay to Rs.3350. In other words for a product worth Rs.3350 , you are ending up paying Rs.5900 by obtaining this card. There is no gain and in fact loss only.
Even if you think that you got the card free, the same calculation applies to points redeeming on Amazon or flipkart. The real benefit is not 3.3%. Its just only 2.2%.
This card is worth if they run either other offers like 2X or 5X rewards etc. And for other benefits like Lounge access etc. of course.
So to conclude â€“ in my opinion -this card is not useful if you hold DCB or equivalent card and till there is 10X rewards on Amazon and flipkart.

Itâ€™s not only about 10x rewards. You may not be spending always on 10X partners or Smartbuy every time. I do lot of offline transactions too some times even for values around 100 Rupees, 50 Rupees etc..
SC Ultimate gives reward points on prorata basis on your spends. Let say if you spend 120 Rupees, you get 4 reward points whereas in HDFC you will get 0 reward points.
Also the reward redemption in SC is currently excellent with lot of Vouchers like Amazon, Flipkart, Big bazaar, Lifestyle, Shopper stop, etc.. which other credit cards doesnâ€™t give.
Itâ€™s really a great card to hold considering the reward rate alone. Apart from that it gives unlimited Domestic lounges access to Primary as well as Add on card holders. 
The reward rate itself will pay more than itâ€™s fee.",CARD EXPERT,Standard Chartered,Old

HDFC REGALIA FIRST,Travel,3/20/19,User,None,"Hi. This is my first post here and I must thank all of you for your contributions, which had helped me to decide to go for the HDFC Regalia First credit card.
The main reason for writing this post is HDFC Bank Interest rates for conversion of your credit card spends on the EMI, which are as follows:
6 months EMI 19.2%
9 months EMI 18%
12 months EMI 15%
24 months EMI 15%
I have converted few spends on EMI on my ICICI Bank basic bare bones credit card before and they charged 13% if i remember correctly. Plus unlike HDFC bank, ICICI Bank does give you the option for 3 months EMI conversion.
I am a preferred banking customer with HDFC. When I called my RM and later the BM, both of them said that they canâ€™t do anything in this and can only â€œforwardâ€ my suggestion.
Have anyone else experienced this kind of interest rates for EMI conversion on your Regalia First or Regalia credit cards? I feel these rates are ridiculously high. Plus no option to repay in 3 months EMI. In fact, the interest rate is more than that of personal loan!
I have always paid my credit card bills in full (total amount due) and before the due date.
Would appreciate any comments which can help me understand if this is how it is with HDFC or I am doing something wrong.
Thank you & best regards.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

Then suddenly last week ( After approx. 6 months), a lady called me saying, some time back i applied for axis credit card, she can process if i still need it. I simply refused. Next day she called again saying they have a offer going on due to financial year closing, where they can offer My Zone or Neo card life time free. I said OK.

On Saturday, i got a call from the executive if they can come to collect document.

I am a government doctor with professional experience more than 30 years. I did not have any credit card before HDFCâ€™s Credit Card which was offered to me in August 2018. My CIBIL was high but there was only one entry which was a closed auto loan I took in 2010. My first credit card was HDFC Regalia.
I have been HDFCâ€™s customer since August 2018 and did not have any account with HDFC. I opened a joint account with my wife as sole owner and I the second owner. The account was categorised as â€˜Preferredâ€™. I have been Regalia with 5 lacs limit since August 2018, this is my earliest association with HDFC. Have been using Regalia, average spend per month was around Rs 87,000. I had sent an email to the Customer Service to upgrade my card in November 2018. They asked for last two ITRs and the computation sheet as well. They sent a representative to collect my ITR and the computation sheet. The most recent ITR was for Rs 36,00,000 and the previous one was for Rs 21,00,000. It almost took 2 months for them to get back to me and approve the card after I talked with one of the higher-ups.
Now the limit on my Infinia is Rs 8,00,000/-. Upon asking my RM why I was approved the card despite not having required relationship with the bank, he said that they treat Government Employee in a different way than they would treat a private sector employee, as the former has highly stable source of income and are reasonable to deal with.
Have been using it for a month. The reward is just crazy. The 10x Reward Points offer is simply awesome as it offers 33% rewards back when shopped via SmartBuy, I just hope it continues post 31st March 2019.

AMAZON PAY ICICI CARD,Shopping,4/2/19,User,None,"Hi Siddharth,
I donâ€™t think the eligibility criteria has got anything to do with Amazon spends. I have been spending a few thousands on Amazon every month since the last 2 years or so for my monthly groceries and daily use household products. Still when I applied for this card about 3 months back, my application was rejected.
I also have a relationship with ICICI (savings account) for more than 10 years now. But I did not have an existing ICICI credit card at the time of applying for ICICI Amazon Pay card.
I think the eligibility is linked to having an exisiting ICICI credit card. I see from your application process, you were asked for your existing ICICI credit card number. You have also mentioned that your card limit was shared with your other ICICI Credit Cards (Jet Sapphiro Amex & Visa).
From the above 2 points (asking for existing ICICI credit card number and sharing limit with existing ICICI credit card), I am guessing that the eligibility criteria is linked to having an existing ICICI credit card. 
The other factors like existing relationship with Amazon (purchasing regularly every month from Amazon) and existing relationship with ICICI Bank (having ICICI savings bank account) did not help me in getting the ICICI Amazon Pay credit card. As I mentioned earlier, my application got rejected about 3 months back.
I was told that I can apply again only after 6 months. Since then 3 months have passed. I will try again after 3 months. In the meantime, I have now got another ICICI credit card. So hoping that this time my application for ICICI Amazon Pay credit card will be accepted ðŸ™‚",CARD EXPERT,ICICI,Old

I never used CCs much after getting the HSBC card though. Everything changed when a friend of mine told me about the AmazonPay ICICI CC. So I checked my amazon and there it was, a LTF free card with a INR 750 joining bonus. I immediately applied through the simple application process. Instant e card generated with a limit of INR 1,30,000. I was delighted. This was mid January 2019.
Now I hold these cards in a period of 3 months
1. HSBC â€“ LTF
2. ICICI Amazon Pay â€“ LTF
3. Amex everyday spends(limit 3,33,000) â€“ Annual Fees 499
4. Citi Premiermiles Visa (Limit 2,26,000) Annual fees â€“ 3000
5. Citi Corporate (Limit 3,30,000) (Which I donâ€™t use much since the rewards arenâ€™t good) (FREE)
I keep traveling for work(Domestic Flights+Hotels+Food+Cabs) and all these cards certainly are useful. For e.g. My spends have already crossed 2,20,000 in the last two months.(Personal+Official). I am thinking I will close the Amex card as I want to play with citi premiermiles for now. Any other card that you guys suggest.
A big change from a cash/debit spend focused person to utilizing credit optimally and reaping the benefits out of the CC rewards. Still learning to maximize my gains.

I got invitation for this card recently. The credit limit is shared with the existing credit limit. The virtual card was created immediately and the physical card was delivered within a week. The card design was pathetic.
Rs.300/- Amazon pay balance was added.
All of you please make a note that you wonâ€™t get any reward points/ Amazon pay balance for converting your transactions into EMI/NO COST EMI including Amazon spends; not exciting. (Read the t&c clearly)
I think the invitation for this card is not linked with the spends of Amazon but, itâ€™s directly linked with the existing credit card. My Jet sapphiro credit card is 3 months old and my spends are good.
I feel that it doesnâ€™t make much sense to have the Jet sapphiro at this juncture as the jet is in deep waters.

CITI PRESTIGE,Lifestyle,4/30/19,User,None,"Hi SH,
The PM conversion is noted.
On the Axis Vistara, i think the best time to get the card is if you are already CV Gold. When you get the card, you are enrolled to CV gold again (which translates to 2X class upgrade vouchers). The milestone benefits & joining benefits (all biz class tickets ) are good.
I had taken the card to actually augment my CV points to plan last minute trips, etc. But with vistara, it is very difficult to find last minute redemption (even more so, in the current scenario) for popular sectors ( DEL-GOI for eg)
But the joining fee is more than compensated by the business class ticket, and you get to keep the Gold Status as long as you hold the card.

HDFC REGALIA FIRST,Travel,5/4/19,User,None,"True, so hereâ€™s what I did when they wasted my time in telling me I will get a credit card, but only to have my application rejected due to some â€œinternal credit policyâ€ added by the fact that someone using the Twitter handle of HDFC asked me for a â€œslipâ€ of proof for dropping something in the drop box â€“ I lost my shit, I typed a lengthy email about them wasting my time and the customer service being annoyingly ridiculous and I ccâ€™ed the entire Board of Directors of the HDFC bank (Yup, I literally went on their site and got the email IDs of the board members and copy pasted them in the email).
48 hours later? I had the credit card I applied for in my hand. 
Some senior customer service team looked in it, apologized for the problems caused, approved and dispatched my Credit card within 24 hours and BlueDart delivered it within the successive 24 hours.

For me Amazon Pay card is best if buying from Amazon or paying using pay balance on sites like MMT. But my primary card is Rubyx Visa variant which gives a decent reward rate of 1.6% and one gets â€œHand Picked Rewardsâ€ and not Payback points in this card. 
â€œHand Picked Rewardsâ€ are very good in terms of options and can be redeemed from ICICI website only. Also milestone benefit if there is one crosses 3lac pa then one gets 3000 Hand picked rewards whose value is approx Rs. 2500 (if redeemed for SS or lifestyle vouchers). Going further for every 1 lac spent one gets 1500 reward points.

AMAZON PAY ICICI CARD,Shopping,5/7/19,User,None,"I regularly checked the link on the Amazon App during January â€“ April, 2019. However, the â€˜Apply Nowâ€™ button was unavailable for me. Following was my status:
1) I was Amazon Prime Member
2) I had not completed full KYC
3) I was not having an ICICI savings account or any other credit card issued by ICICI.
4) I used to regularly order through Amazon or use Amazon Pay balance for Swiggy / bill payments etc., but not that I had spent over a lakh in past few months or so.
5) My location was Delhi
6) I was holding Citi Cashback credit card (with limit of around Rs. 2.50 lakh for past 2 years) and Amex MRCC Card (with limit of Rs. 3.50 lakh for past 1 year)
During the last week of April, suddenly the invite button was available and I quickly applied for the same. Hereâ€™s the brief process that was followed:
1) After clicking on the button, I had to provide few details like name, address, date of birth, PAN, residential address, employer name (luckily, my employer name figured in the drop down list. One may never know if the application got successfully approved only if all the parameters got ticked) etc. After inputting those details, I was displayed the following message â€œThank You for applying for Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card.
your application is under process. The Executive will call you within 5 days to schedule an appointment & will visit at the below address within 7 days.â€ Though, the process did not ask for details of any other existing credit cards.
2) Received a call on April 29 at around 11:30 am from ICICI and a verification visit was scheduled next day at my residential address between 12-1pm.
3) Executive reached my residential address at around 4pm on April 30. He scanned my original aadhaar and pan card, clicked my photo and entered few other KYC details, all done from his backend ICICI app on his mobile. Thereafter, I received an SMS from ICICI and was also asked by the executive to send an SMS â€˜AMZ YESâ€™ to the number 9215676766 from my mobile to complete the application. I was also asked to sign a physical one pager form which was basically acknowledging that I have read all the terms and conditions of the card. There was no furnishing of photocopies or photographs. Also, I was not asked to furnish any income documents nor were they scanned.
4) Soon, in the presence of the executive, I received an SMS that my application form was successfully completed and sent for further processing. Similar status was being displayed on the Amazon App. I was told by the executive that there will be no further verification/visit at the office address. I remember that, while filling out the details on the Amazon App during the initial application process, I had the option to choose the visit at either my residential address or office address. I had chosen my residential address.
5) Status remained the same for next 48 hours or so.
5) On May 02, at around 4:45pm, received an email and SMS that my card has been approved. After about half an hour, I got an SMS with details of user id with which I can login to see my card details etc.
6) On May 04, at around 11:15 am, I received the physical card at my residence through blue dart (Had received an SMS in the morning from bluedart that card was out for delivery).
Following are few other details of the approved card:
1) Received the credit limit of Rs. 3,03,000/-
2) There is visa branding (but there is no mention of visa variant i.e., whether it is classic, gold, platinum, signature etc.) So I assume, its just a normal visa credit card.
3) Successfully added the card on the Cred App on 06 May. Cred initiated a token credit of Rs. 1 to the card and it was credited on the same day to the card.
So, the invite became available to me and the card got approved despite not having ICICI savings account or ICICI credit card.

HDFC DINERS CLUB BLACK,Lifestyle,5/22/19,User,None,"Hi
If I were you Iâ€™d wait till May 31st to apply for DCB.
But given how they are reducing the 10x durations to intervals of 1 month for smartbuy vs 3/4 months last few years, 10x itself being eased may not be an incorrect reading.
It also needs some crazy spends to justify achieving 25K points per month with the other 10x partners.
With your old relationship with Citibank and probably your ITR, getting Citi Prestige (CP), combining Rewards and Premier Miles credit lines to CP may not be entirely out of place.
Iâ€™m presuming you are a high spender, given the Axis Vistara usage that you have detailed.
CP may just complement your lifestyle well in that case (Even if it means adding another Visa Infinite to your kitty!).
But the value and earn CP offers at its current annual fees is unbeatable.
Having an MRCC to kick off things with Amex may not be a bad ploy too.

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,6/3/19,User,None,"Hi,
I have been a Regalia customer since 3 years and last month got notification to upgrade to Infinia. My Regalia credit limit is 10L+. My Regalia was LTF. Initially I was skeptical to pay 10K every year but what I see is that if you dont hit the Rs 8Lakhs spend to waive the fee, you do get 10K membership points (worth Rs 10K since 1RP = 1Rs) . Few questions I had:
â€“ What is GST on the Annual Fee? Is it 6%?
â€“ For rewards points, I could only see that there would be no earnings for Fuel. Is that right?
â€“ For insurance payments, there is a cap of 2000 points per transaction. Does this mean that we get rewards on insurance payments upto Rs 60K per transaction?
â€“ I see in comments above that â€œNo points for recharges/bill payment/ utility paymentâ€. I could not find that in terms and conditions anywhere. Can someone point me to that?
â€“ Can someone help clarify: â€œNo rewards points for e-wallet loading transactionsâ€. Even if I do not have say cash in Paytm or Phonepayâ€¦when I scan a code to make payment via credit card, Iâ€™m assuming it still gets credited to one of the wallets first before moving to the end client. So in summary can we say that no rewards points when making payment using any wallet?

SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,6/4/19,User,None,"I am really disappointed by the scb ultimate credit card. They hardly give much options for redemption under ultimate category. Whereas some of the vouchers are available under other categories available on the site.
I think their card value has depreciated over time, as many other credit card reward redemption system have never ending vouchers for flipkart and amazon and many other.
I think all the user/customers of ultimate credit card should write in to the grievance department of the card for issue resolving.

I thought ultimate is never issued less than 5l but my case is proof that Ultimate can be issued with any CL. I donot have any relationship with SCB at all. I have no idea how this CL was arrived. I recvd PP and Dineout Card too along with Ultimate card.

A highly unresponsive customer care which doesn't have email support to avoid honouring commitments they then have the audacity to say that in fine print they have written full wiaver to a maximum of 1% . What's the point of saying full waiver when actually levying 3% and waiving a measely 1%. I asked them to send the breakup of  transaction charges and charge slip charges  on email to take up the issue the CC simply refused.

I insisted and then the bank changed its tune to say that the 2% have been levied by the merchant . I asked them to simply send me an email or charge statement showing the breakup of various charges on this transaction but the executive was hanky Panky. In today's age a bank without an email support. Really HSBC U WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT.  Plus it takes 20 minutes to reach a human on the IVR.  ZERO STAR,MOUTH SHUT,HSBC,New

1. First call the Amazon Pay ICICI credit card number. Itâ€™s a special dedicated number given at the back of your card.
2. After the card verification, ask them the Customer ID for the credit card. It will be a new Customer ID other than the previous ID.
3. After getting the customer ID, you are supposed to reset the password online through net banking interface. I faced a problem here, when I tried to generate the password for the new Customer ID I received from the ICICI CC, I was shown an error message on the website that no mobile number is attached to this Customer ID.
4. I then called the customer care of Amazon pay ICICI card and told them my customer ID after card verification. I told them to link m mobile number to the existing customer care given by them. They confirmed that Mobile number was not linked (even though I was receiving all other sms for the Credit card).
5. They took the request for linking the mobile number to the Customer ID. I received an sms that the same will be linked in one business day. But it was linked in 1-2 hours only.
6. Once the linking is done, you can set password online and voila!! You are inside the net banking and can now see the card.

Congratulations on such a wonderful forum about details and feedback on CC.
I have been using HDFC Regalia LTF from last 8 years or so with my present limit being 8 Lakhs. I also hold an imperia relationship with the bank. Recently, I was offered an upgrade for Infinia card from HDFC on my net banking account. Since I was not sure about the benefits of Infinia card and also the fact that below the upgrade, there were annual charges mentions so I thought why go for a paid card when Regalia is working fine as LTF. So, I did not accept the offer for Infinia card and now after reading the details on this forum , I checked once again on my net banking whether the Infinia upgrade option still exists or not. But now, they have removed the upgrade option from my net banking accoint
But as I read this forum , I realise that Infinia is one card which is something rare to get and is given to few chosen ones only. So, I want to know if I have really missed out on something precious. And if yes, is there a possibility to get it back?
Do I have to get in touch with the bank or bank will again make me another offer for Infinia card just the way they did last time??

My friend who is BM opened my account and I had to submit ITR of 35+ to get that. Although its not LTF only joining is free.
I have few questions â€“
1. I know wallet and fuel transactions dont accrue points bu do they count towards annual milestone spend. If I cover my paytm additions, I can easily cross 8 lac.
2. Is there any benefit if I link all insurance to auto pay on HDFC card ? I have 4 insurance and do we get some x points on autopay ?
Please guide.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

2) Has SCB changed the point value for this card till date, cos it drastically decreased it for Manhattan sometime back. Could it become less on renewal.
3) To earn the 3.3% reward rate, are there any exclusions like wallet loads, utility payments, insurance payments, fuel transactions or any other which do not earn any points.

HDFC REGALIA ,Travel,8/31/19,User,None,"Hi Siddhart, great insights as always and youâ€™re the main go to person online for comparing credit cards. I have a query on whether I should go for the Regalia card considering I have been using Citibank Premier Miles card for about 3-4 year now. I mostly use my credit card points for flight redemption and nothing else really. I am happy with the current Citibank PM card but however, it does not have any international lounge access, considering I travel 3-4 times a year abroad. Moreover, Citibank would never waive off the annual fee of Rs.3000 even if you spend a lot. ( I am not a Citibank Account holder and only use the credit card) . Though I get 3000 miles on renewal equivalent to Rs.1350 (3000*0.45) and in reality paying Rs. 1650, do you think its worth it or would HDFC REGALIA give me a better value in terms of redemption and overall benefits? Again, Kindly take into account I mostly use the reward points for booking flights on MMT, Yatra.

The beauty of this card is with the Amazon Pantry offers. Generally from 4th to 7th of the month Amazon Pantry shopping of more than Rs 1500 has a 15% instant discount for ICICI bank credit cards. If you use this card , it will give 5% cashback after the monthly statement also. If you landed on the page from ICICI bank flat 4% cashback link this will end up being a 24% cashback. Amazon Pay ICICI CC is the most transparent and easiest in cashbacks. Further you donâ€™t have to have great skills in maximising redemptions . Simple and efficient are two words to describe this card.
Other cards competing on Amazon are not so simple. For SBI card , you have to land on Amazon through YONO to get 5% cashback. HDFC cards have to land through smart buy for the rewards/cashback. Both take a lot of time in realisation of rewards and cashbacks. Rewards are like coupons which everyone is not able to cash in. Rewards result in redemptions where you end up spending more money even if you really did not require the expenditure to be done. Simple cashbacks are better for people who want to save money. In my opinion this is a great card.",CARD EXPERT,ICICI,Old

2) The maximum Cashback of Rs 750 per month is per category, meaning 3 categories so max total cashback Rs.2250 theoretically is possible
3) Transactions via PayZapp and SmartBuy and all online spends less than 2000 would earn 1% or not earn any points? can someone confirm this.
4) Points expire in 1 year and minimum required are 2500 and a fee of Rs.99 applies?

Iâ€™m currently holding DCB LTF with 7. 5L CL. I have been offered dual card Regalia LTF along with existing DCB LTF with limit split between the two. Or I can choose to get myself upgraded to Infinia LTF with 8+ limit but then itâ€™s not being offered as a dual card.
Any thoughts/suggestions as I have 3 options
1. Retain DCB LTF with 7.5L limit
2. Dual card â€“ DCB LTF with 4.5 limit and Regalia LTF with 3L limit
3. Get DCB upgraded to INFINIA.
I found DCB to be better in terms of rewards with 10x partners and unlimited lounge access. However, Infinia offers unlimited lounge access (International) to primary and add on cards. Domestic lounges are capped I believe..Also infina offerers 2X on Dining. Holding DCB and Regalia specially Visa variant will fill in for the PP and BMS offers.

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,10/5/19,User,None,"I would stick with #2, unless your spends are huge and you arenâ€™t worried about Diners acceptability â€“ in which case you could go with #1.
#2, depending on your DCB spends over time, can reach #1 levels.
Maxing out Visa spends regularly and ITR increase over time may just, JUST, tip the scales towards getting an Infinia upgrade in due course.
Regalia also covers the acceptability angle with #2.
6 International lounge accesses are covered by Regaliaâ€™s PP.
Domestic too is covered twice per qtr? by Regalia. 
So unless you are a massive lounge user, locally and internationally, #2 should still do. 
Regalia (Signature) almost always has similar â€˜significantâ€™ Visa offers as Infinia (Infinite).
Visa India website offers section can help.
(Happy to be corrected).
Ex. Offers for Hilton Gold and Hyatt Dining Club are alike.
Uber Premier 10x is same for all HDFC credit cards.

1. Vendor Partner 10x
2. Miles transfer to more airlines and a hotel
3. International 10x (fixed period) on and off.
Substantial if you know the sweet spots on British Airways, Vistara, etc. 
What are you losing with DCB vs Infinia?
1. 10K RP per month
2. Acceptability
3. Free domestic lounge access for Add on card

Hope you are aware that Vistara Infinite is a paid one and the joining fee is around 12k,if you are frequent traveller in Vistara Business class and you can spend 7.5 ;Lakhs/year then you can go for this card else not advisable especially with Vistara still not having great connectivity in the domestic routes",CARD EXPERT,Axis Bank,Old
AXIS VISTARA INFINITE,Travel,10/15/19,User,None,"Rakesh,
Go for Vistara Infinite only if you are based in a city well serviced by Vistara ( which means mainly DEL NCR & to a lesser extent now BOM). There is no point spending 12k on a card & not able to reap any benefits out of it.
However, if you are based in either of these locations, then it may make sense to get the card.
Also, remember, the tickets are issued at each milestone of 2.5 lacs & the ticket on the joining fee takes the longest to come ( take 2 months min). So if you can time the 2.5L spend within say 3 months of the card, you will have 2 business class tickets to redeem, hopefully for the same trip.
The card also gives you CV Gold Status, the benefits which you can read on the Vistara website.",CARD EXPERT,Axis Bank,Old

Depnding on what spend you can achieve even vistara siganture or platnium is also not a bad specially when you are a frequent flier.

Make the best use of Regalia for Smartbuy, Vistara for insurance payments, etc. Vistara Infinite will give you CV Gold status ( upto you how importantly you value that). But with an upgrade to DCB using the Regalia, you have another avenue of earning CV miles ( Vistara is a DCB transfer partner).

This is a wonderful website you are maintaining and the comments section is very informative.
After going though your review and based on the user comments I decided to apply for Diners Black Credit Card.
Since I donâ€™t have an existing relationship with HDFC, I applied directly on the Diners Black website.
I was surprised to see that my credit score was immediately checked on CIBIL. Since I have registered for paid membership on CIBIL I got an alert on my email. My credit score dropped from 850 -> 846 due to the New Enquiry.
In the next 1 hour I got a call from the customer support and she arranged for my documents to be picked up, all done in 3 hours from applying online.
Documents submitted:
* Aadhar Card
* PAN Card
* Company ID card

CITI PRESTIGE,Lifestyle,11/17/19,User,None,"Just to check, I chose a hotel at random (Sheraton downtown Dubai) and checked the prices for it using Hotels.com website for 4 nights. The cost for it comes to about 33000 (excluding breakfast).
Then I opened MMT and Goibibo, checked the prices for the same hotel for 5 nights for the same dates, the price for it was approx. 33000 (inclusive of breakfast)
I am not going to book this, I took this for reference only.
Given that the prestige card gives the 5th night free, what is the point of booking through them if it costs the same. It seems theyâ€™re basically fooling around with the customers who donâ€™t have time to search for the best prices on the internet by making a fancy concierge.
In this reference, 5th night free would actually make sense only if I end up paying lesser than what is already the market price, according to which, the price for 4 nights should have been approx. 26000 and then the 5th night using the CITI Prestige should have been made free.
So, in actual youâ€™re paying the same youâ€™d have on some other website but by booking it through CITI prestige or concierge, one believes that they got the 5th night for free. 
The same I have seen on the premiermiles website, HDFC smartbuy flight booking portal, AMEX travel portal. Say, if a flight ticket costs 75000 on a website (which is offering it for the lowest price), the same ticket will always be 7-8000 or sometimes even 10-15k more expensive. In return, what they fool the customers around with is 10X points. How do people call it savings when you are paying more upfront, getting back points which would still not match up the lowest priced ticket if redeemed.

I am willing to ensure 8 lakh or more spends on the card, but I guess HDFC is too snobbish to bureaucratic while offering anything to their existing customers.
If not approved, I will close my Salary Account and stop Insurance payment from them. Soon, I will cancel the Regalia Credit Card as well.

Got a pop-up in my NetBanking last week and went click click click. It gave me two options of Diners Black and Infinia. It even gave me the option to select some service of Smart Buy and the card would be Lifetime Free. 
I chose the Infinia and card got delivered today with 9L limit, and Iâ€™m only impressed with the packaging, honestly. Checked the exclusions, Fuel, Wallet Loading and EMI transactions are not eligible for points â€“ disappointing.
At the time of redemption 1 point is = 1 Rupee only for Flight and Hotel bookings via Smart Buy website. Everything else the redemption value of 1 point is = 50 paise. 
Checked with the Call Centre and the card will become Lifetime Free after 90 days automatically. I also have a Standard Chartered Ultimate and thatâ€™s a far better card, no transactions are exempt and all points are 1 Rupee at the time of redemption.
Only downside of the Ultimate to the Infinia is no unlimited Priority Pass Lounge visits, and thatâ€™s really okay.

I have this CC and although Axis says that it gives 1.5% cashback on each transaction, I have noticed that they reduce the cashback in every transaction by removing the decimal points completely. They donâ€™t even round off, they simply remove all decimals. For ex. if u purchase worth 1790, although 1.5% is 26.85 rs but they will give u cashback only of 26. So Axis will pocket the remaining 0.85 rs and they do this in all transactions.

No other card gives blanket 1.5% cashback for all spends. except for dcb &infinia, but they are not giving me either of the cards.
I saw hsbc cashback 1% on weekdays and 1.5% on weekends. this card is better compared to that.
Pros:
â€“ I use ubereats more than Flipkart, so 4% is a good default cashback option.
â€“ 1.5% default cashback is a good cashback to get behind this card for credit card beginners.
â€“ All cashback are credited 3 days before the next billing cycle, so overall you need to pay less. which is equivalent to cash in hand at the next billing.
â€“ Statement is very clear about cashback for each transaction.
Only downside I am facing is that cashback is rounded down to the lowest value. even if u r eligible for 2.95rs. They will credit you only 2 rs. You wonâ€™t lose much in high-value transactions. eg. spending 1495 you will be eligible for Rs. 22.4 but you will be credit only 22 so the effective cashback is 1.47%. but the smaller ones u lose more. eg. if you spend 130 u are eligible for 1.95 but you will be credited only 1 rs which makes effective cashback to 0.76%",CARD EXPERT,Axis Bank,Old

AXIS FLIPKART,Shopping,12/13/19,User,None,"Axis customer support is plain horrible. I already have axis signature credit card and I also have salary account with Axis. I called customer care once in September and once in October to apply to this credit card. They said their sales team will get back to me. Nothing happened. Third time I applied online by providing all the details and then finally their sales person called me to arrange document pickup. So, even though I have salary account + credit card, I had to submit the documents once again. Then for next 1 month, no updates.. The customer care person said that I have to apply for card again. This when they had already made a CIBIL enquiry. Then I had to escalate the issue. After two days, card was approved and dispatched couple of days later. I didnâ€™t liked the packaging much, one of the simplest card packaging I have received. The card has a separate limit than my existing credit card. Itâ€™s almost 4X time my monthly take home, so no complaints there.
The fact that 4% wonâ€™t be applicable on MMT/Goibibo with coupons is a very big disappointment.
Now comes the most horrendous part. A week after receiving the credit card, I get a scam/phishing call. The caller knew I had applied for axis bank credit card. They were asking for last 6 digits of my card, what variant it was (flipkart/neo), were confirming expiry date (since they knew it was issued last month, so they were able to take correct guess) and whether it was mastercard/visa. And I realized that only that information was enough for phishing guys to do an international transaction. Wow. I had a very interesting conversation with the girl trying to scam me. First I fed up all wrong information to her just to see where this was going. Later when I called out on scam, she got angry and started cursing me, saying â€œwe work so hard, itâ€™s not easy to scam peopleâ€ and then threatened that she is anyways going to transact on my card.
So somewhere during the process my name, my number and the fact that I was applying for an axis credit card was leaked. And it worries me that a phishing group has my mobile number and name.

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,12/27/19,User,None,"Hi Sid,
I have 10 savings and current accounts with hdfc and 7 demat accounts. I have been a credit card holder with HDFC since 2000 and slowly was upgraded to Regalia. I have been holding Regalia for 6 years now. Two years back, I had a limit of Rs 10 lakhs on Regalia. So, I applied for Diners Black. The credit limit was split in half and now I have a Diners Black with a credit limit of Rs 8 Lakhs and Regalia with a limit of 5 lakhs. My spends on Diners Black are high while that on Regalia are negligible. My attempts to upgrade to Infinia have not been successful.
Meanwhile, my momâ€™s regalia limit suddenly increased from Rs 2 lakhs to Rs 10 Lakhs despite minimal usage. So, she applied for a diners black with a split limit like me but her application was rejected because as per new policy HDFC issues only one card to one person. So she went to the branch and the credit card team called up the call centre who offered her an Infinia. So she now has an Infinia.
Meanwhile, my relationship manager was pursuing me to get my dad a credit card since he did not own one. He filled up a form for business regalia, but was then informed that there is an offer for LTF Business Regalia online so he should accept the offer online. When we went online, there was an offer for Diners Black as well. We chose that offer and my dad was issued a Diners Black as his first ever credit card.
I felt that one of the things that is going against me getting an upgrade offer to Infinia is that I hold two cards despite the combined limit being Rs 13 lakhs. So I decided to cancel my Regalia card as 1. I was hardly using it for the past two years as Diners Black was my primary card, and 2. I was told that you can get an upgrade offer against my Diners Club Black card as well.
Finally cancelled my Regalia card after owning it for 6 years. I have good memories of it before it got devalued.",CARD EXPERT,HDFC Bank,Old

Infact this is my first HDFC credit card. They denied 2 years back when i am new to the branch even with eligible income. I am a doctor by profession with eligible ITR of 45LPA. Recently i applied through bank credit card person (different guy, did the job for me) who got approval from his boss and finally got a president seal at Chennai office. At the time of approval i had >10 L FD, HDFC life insurance along with saving account with salary credit (~2yrs). 
Need few suggestions from Siddarth or experts.

2). What are the useful and must have complimentary cards along with Infinia if eligible to get?
3). Should i apply for one of e-commerce cards (ICICI Amazon pay/ Flipkart axis card/Paytm city) ?

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,12/30/19,User,None,"1. Best option is Infinia. Net earnings on Infinia while using it abroad= 3.30% â€“ 2.35% = 0.95%. So, its always beneficial to use Infinia.

2. 2nd best option is Niyo FX card. Itâ€™s on a visa platform, so anyone accepting cards will surely accept this card. Load INR into the card and freely spend in whatever currency you like. There are no charges for FX transaction.
3. 3rd best option is to take HDFC FX card. Load INR into it. Withdraw cash in ATM in SL. Charges will be 2.35% + any ATM withdrawal charges, which will still be cheaper than buying LKR (cash) from India.

The standard chartered ultimate credit card rewards are getting worst from worse.
They offer an excellent reward rate, but I think it is use less with the options of rewards they offer under the ultimate tab. It is just a gimmick of offering this kind of reward points which do not hold any kind on value.
So I would suggest the people who are planning to apply for this credit card, rather to go for any other, which offers less rewards but useful ones.

Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong. Thanks.",CARD EXPERT,Standard Chartered,Old
SC ULTIMATE,Rewards,1/23/20,User,None,"Your thinking is correct. However, consider this point. Most of the people having the SCB Ultimate have either an HDFC DCB or Infinia which gives the same level of rewards in terms of RP, Lounge access, Golf Games plus the added Fee Waiver at 5 & 8 Lacs annual spends respectively.
In SCB ultimate, while they are giving 5000 Points, you are still paying 900 Rs. GST additional. This gets covered in RP, however, if you dont have good redemption options then the value of RPs drops drastically.
On the other hand, the redemption options in HDFC are exponentially more than SCB Ultimate right now. SCB guys havenâ€™t even bothered to change JetPrivilege Miles to InterMiles yet.

recently i wrote a mail to the following in the standard chartered banking grievance cell
1. customer care
2. head of customer care services
3. nodal officer
4. principal nodal officer
regarding the pathetic reward redemption system in standard chartered, specially under the ultimate tab.
my letter to them was as under
Hi,
I am a Standard Chartered Ultimate credit card Holder.
I want to bring it to your notice in the form of a complaint, that the company you have out-sourced for the redemption of the credit card reward, is making the company as well as the customers fool, by not offering any ways to redeem the points that are earned of the spends done on the credit card. Under the ultimate tab specially, their are only 11 products now as compared to the 51 options that were their earlier. And of the 11 products available, no product has any kind of value to the customer.
after writing this mail to them i got an immediate response by them in 24hours, that my problem will be resolved within 2 working days.
and exactly after 2 working days, the standard chartered portal, was updated with the redemption options.
and now they have everything on the portal, naming
1. big bazaar
2. book my show
3. lifestyle
4. croma
5. shopperstop
6. westside
7. make my trip
and many others.
so please i would suggest all the credit card holders of the standard chartered, please write a letter to all four grievance divisions of the standard chartered banking system, so that these options do not go away from their portal ever in the future as well
thanks and regards

Usually these vouchers are there in 360 ultimate, only amazon flipkart have not been seen for a very long period.
This card is not that bad. It has joining as well as renewal benefits, 3.3% rewards, uber, ola benefit, lounge, priority pass, golf,etc.
Some reward redemption problems are present, they need to work on that, add more vouchers, like amazon flipkart, more redemption options, try to keep the vouchers at all times,etc.

I received no response from Axis for a week. I called the customer care and the executive told me that the distance between my residence and working place is around 130 km. They wanted me to send an email declaration. I did the same. After that I received a message stating that you would get the approval/disapproval confirmation within 72 hours. After 3 days, I got the message stating my card was approved.

(Purely speculating, donâ€™t even have Infinia. Based on my exp, Iâ€™ve seen HDFC giving limits of 5x of your monthly net. So a monthly net of 4-5 L you may get 20L limit if old customer.

HDFC INFINIA,Lifestyle + Travel,3/18/20,User,None,"Thanks Sid for the excellent work. 
I have been eyeing for Infinia and finally got it today. I got Diners black and Citi Prestige in 2016 and since been planning to get upgraded to Infinia mostly due to low acceptance of diners. I have not been using much of the prestige card benefits and 20k fee has been mostly a waste (forgot last year to apply for 10k Taj/ITC voucher â€“ yes u donâ€™t get unless u make the request and it lapse if not requested intime). But I needed two cards for travel purpose and low acceptance of Diners. 
For the interest of the group, I tried through customer service few times but never had a positive response. So 2 weeks back walked into nearest HDFC branch and met the manager. My business card (MD title) and ITR (7 figure) got the branch manager really excited. I donâ€™t do much business with HDFC only a savings account with bare minimum balance. He requested some special bank account to open (5l initial deposit) and 25k min balance afterwards. I thought it to be a good deal as I can get rid of the Citi prestige. I made it conditional to getting the Infinia. Initial idea was to get additional card (Diners + Infinia) but he came back that only one card possible hence bumped to Infinia. All points have been transferred to Infinia at 1:1 ratio. CL is same as diners ~ 10l. Same on prestige. 
Any suggestions which card to keep as secondary? Not interested to pay annual fee. My CC expand is roughly 20l (business travel).

Should I stick on using Elite or dump/degrade it after one year? Will I will be charged after 1 year? If charged, will I get voucher as initially?
2. Iâ€™m already utilizing lounge benefits using regalia first. But SBI Elite is acceptable in few more airports (eg: Goa, I am from there) where Regalia doesnâ€™t work though Lounge is not that good. 
3. How Should I utilize my cards- which card for which kind of transactions? My annual spends range around AVG 2-3 Lacs.
